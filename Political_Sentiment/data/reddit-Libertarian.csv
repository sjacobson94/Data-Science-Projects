Affirmative action

Mail-in voting

Immigration

Same Sex marriage

""Women's rights""

School closures

Police brutality

And on and on, these are all issues that require independent though processes in order to be objective. But what happens? Party A takes position X, and suddenly EVERYONE who call themselves party A is in agreement. These are not independent positions. If you had any semblance of an independent thought process, surely you would deviate from your chosen party on SOME, but more likely, MANY of these issues. But people do not do that, because they are manipulated by their party through lies of omission, misrepresentation of facts, and often even outright lies.

Fucking masks are a great example, because it went from a 100% non-issue to IMMEDIATELY being a partisan issue in a matter of weeks/months.

E: Please stop giving me awards. I appreciate the sentiment, but if you want to give some money away, donate it to EFF, ACLU, The Innocence Project, or 2AF, instead of a conglomerate who are working to silence discussion.

Some of you are arguing some or literally all of these positions in this post. This is not a poll. You're missing the point.

Others are claiming they are 100% percent agreed with a specific position or individual. You are also missing the point. Read it again.

Also, the issues I stated are just that. I did not attach any political leanings to them, so stop saying ""I agree/disagree with this list"" because there's nothing to agree with.",1596698932.0

According to Joe, every firearm that’s basically not a revolver or bolt-action rifle is shoved under the NFA. They give you a choice: pay the $200 tax and keep your weapons or forfeit them to the government. 

How do you realistically think this will play out? I’ll tell you: Me and my lucky buddies pay the $200 and keep our guns. Every upper middle class person with an “assault weapon” pays the $200 tax, and no significant number of large weapons are relinquished. Meanwhile, every low-income person says “fuck that, I’ll take my chances because it could mean my life” and keeps their gun. Suddenly felony charges increase. Mandatory minimums are doled out. Next thing you know, we’re reading about mass incarceration of young black men who had a mag over 10 rounds while being busted for some minuscule amount of weed. 

His plan even calls for some state-approved storage method. Who do you think this targets? The suburban gun owners?! HA! Do you think the Vegas shooter wouldn’t pay the $200 to keep his gun that he killed all those people with? Do you think a suicide will be prevented by handing out felonies for 10+ round mags?

Welcome to the War On Drugs 2.0

**Edit:** Oh, and I also just realized that this plan will actually *skyrocket* gun sales, especially those soon to been banned from sale. For example, if I know an AR-15 is about to be illegal to purchase BUT I can get it now and pay a $200 tax to keep it, you bet your ass I’m buying one.

**Edit 2** A lot if you are asking where the $200 tax is in Biden’s platform. It is currently part of the NFA plan. Could Dems change the law to waive the tax? Uh, sure. What’s more likely is they adjust for inflation as this $200 is based off 1933 law. I highly doubt they’ll waive the tax and say “Yea man just keep your guns at no cost or forfeit them!”",1596805206.0

Rank choice voting can change this permanently.

Reason 2 endless wars. I think the war on terrorist NEEDS to end! It's been going on for years. I think we should only send troops to war when the enemy on American soil or if WW3 happens

Reason 3: they ""want"" to have a smaller government


Reason 4: They don't support LGBT rights/gay marriage. They're is nothing wrong with being gay, why should we ban them from getting married?

Reason 5: They deny climate change, nuff said

***This is being updated regularly as more is uncovered, so check back!  Dark to Light!***

In September 2015 Virginia Roberts Giuffre (VRG) sued Ghislaine Maxwell for defamation in New York federal court.  The documents unsealed today by Judge Preska are those that were filed under seal in that case in 2015.

There is overlap with older unsealed documents, so some of this may not be new.  More will be released Monday.

[The source documents are here.](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355835/giuffre-v-maxwell/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc)  The link may be down at times.

I am finding that all of the so called compilation PDFs, ZIPs, and dumps are incomplete or parts of the old Epstein docs of 2019.  Only go to the above for the new docs.

[These are the older Epstein files released in 2019, a 2024 page PDF](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6250471-Epstein-Docs.html).

There is some confusion about what documents are old and what is newly unsealed, which may be deliberate attempts to muddy the waters.

He is the natural consequence of a process that started long ago, when we put Japanese Americans on prison camps for no reason other than their ethnicity or when we became indifferent to undeclared wars on false pretenses,  to supporting dictators overseas and when we started practicing torture and assassinations as a matter of state policy.  All of that would eventually lead to where we are today.",1595497373.0

Seems to me that a lot of people, young people especially, can tell you a whole lot about a Congressional race in a state they’ve never been to, but can’t name the people running for their Council districts. 

State and Municipal government still has a lot of power. If you start gaining power there, you can start shaping the National conversation a lot easier. 

Never mind the fact that many of the major conversations in this country today, like education, fair housing, and police reform, stem from city and state services. Federal funding for racial justice or education don’t mean shit if it’s delivered to a city or state government unwilling to spend it or that is going to spend it poorly.


Every single person who wants a third party, this is where you need to start. Your chances for winning go way up in smaller elections. Especially if you have actual support. It's a long road to a national third party candidate victory, and that road is paved with local electoral victories across the country.

132,Why I believe Trump fascist,206,i06njk,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/i06njk/why_i_believe_trump_is_a_fascist/,472,"Over the past several months I have begun calling Donald Trump a fascist. I have since been told by some of my conservative friends that this is an unfair characterization. I hope to illustrate here that, by any reasonable definition of the term, Trump is undeniably fascist. 

Historian Roger Griffin has described fascist political ideology as a form of palingenetic ultranationalism. Fascists believe that the country was once great, but that society’s decadence has caused it to fall from its former greatness. However, the fascist believes that we can return to this past greatness and, through a societal rebirth, we can make the country great again. While Griffin’s work does an excellent job describing the core of fascist political ideology, we must look further for a more complete definition of the term.  Although there is no universally accepted definition of fascism, the Encyclopedia Britannica lists several general characteristics that fascist movements tend to have in common. Many of these are exhibited by Donald Trump and his movement.

**Totalitarian ambitions**

While Hitler was careful not to reveal the full extent of his totalitarian aims before he came to power, as Führer, he attempted not only to control all political power but also to dominate opposing institutions and organizations outside of the state. The best way to illustrate Trump’s totalitarian ambitions is through his own words. For instance, Trump had this to say about the Tiananmen square massacre: “The Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak.” When discussing Xi Jinping’s appointment as president for life Trump made these comments: “He's now president for life, president for life. And he's great, and look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot someday.”

**Opposition to Marxism**

Fascists made no secret of their hatred of Marxists of all stripes, from totalitarian communists to democratic socialists. When rising to power, fascists promise to deal more firmly with Marxists than earlier, more democratic conservative movements. Trump has a similar hatred of Marxism and frequently labels his political opponents as socialist or Marxist. One example of this kind of rhetoric can be seen in Trump’s speech on Jul, 5th 2020: “We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters, and people who, in many instances, have absolutely no clue what they are doing.“ The language Trump uses in his attacks on Marxism resembles that of previous fascist leaders such as Mussolini and Hitler.

**Opposition to political and cultural liberalism**

Although circumstances sometimes make accommodation to political liberalism necessary, fascists generally condemn liberal political doctrines. Trump has demonstrated his opposition to liberalism through his demonization of the free press, his attacks on peaceful protesters, and his support for overreaching state surveillance programs.

**Conservative economic programs**

The economic programs of the great majority of fascist movements were extremely conservative, favouring the wealthy over the middle and working classes. Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy and other such policies illustrate his support for conservative social programs which favor the upper class. Even now, in the depths of an economic crisis brought about by a global pandemic, Trump’s party is proposing cuts to unemployment, social security, and Medicare.

**Opposition to parliamentary democracy**

While fascists are often willing to engage in electoral politics in order to gain power, they tend to abandon democratic processes once they obtain power. We’ve seen this with Trump and the Republican party more broadly as they have opposed various democratic electoral reforms including reinstatement of the Voting Rights Act, early voting expansion, gerrymandering reform, absentee ballots, automatic voter registration, ranked choice voting, and the national popular vote for president. The president has also pushed for delaying the presidential election.

**Military values**

Fascists generally  place a strong emphasis on the military and embrace military values such as courage, obedience to authority, discipline, and physical strength. We’ve seen this with Trump’s increased funding to the already bloated military budget and his emphasis on the military in his many speeches. In the president’s own words: “Our military and the strength of our military and the strengthening of our military is a number one priority for the Trump administration.”

**Violence**

Fascists react to their opponents with physical force. Mussolini used his Blackshirts to assault socialist organizers throughout Italy, and Hitler used his storm troopers to attack any opposition to the Nazi party. In recent months, the Trump administration has started utilizing similar tactics by sending federal agents to attack peaceful protestors in both Portland and Washington DC. Prior to this, the president regularly advocated for violence against political adversaries in numerous speeches.

**Extreme nationalism** 

Fascists believe that national identity should be the foundation of individual identity and should not be corrupted by foreign left-wing influences. Trump unapologetically embraces nationalism through his constant appeals to American exceptionalism, protectionist policies, constant criticisms of foreign powers, and withdrawal from international treaties and organizations.

**Scapegoating**

Fascists often blame their countries’ problems on scapegoats. Jews, Marxists, and immigrants were among the most commonly demonized groups in Nazi Germany. Likewise, the Trump administration has demonized Marxists, immigrants, and Muslims. He has accused Mexican immigrants of being rapists and criminals, called for a ban on Muslims immigrating into the country, and accused Marxists of destroying the nation. 

**Antiurbanism** 

Fascist generally pander to antiurban sentiments. For instance, the Nazis won most of their electoral support from rural areas by painting the ideal German as a simple peasant, in contrast to the elitist urban intellectual. We have seen similar antiurban sentiment expressed by Trump and his supporters through their demonization of Democratic-governed cities on a wide range of issues in an attempt to appeal to rural and suburban white voters.

**Sexism and misogyny**

Misogyny is another common characteristic of fascist states. Under these regimes women are typically urged to perform their traditional gender roles and deviations from traditional gender roles are often demonized. For instance, Mussolini instituted policies severely restricting women’s access to jobs outside the home and, in Germany, the Nazis forbade female party members from giving orders to male members. Donald Trump’s sexism is hardly a secret. In October of 2016, the Washington Post published that tape of Donald Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women. Of course this is far from the only display of Trump’s blatant misogyny. He has a disturbing habit of sexualizing his own daughter’s body, he has hired an astoundingly small number of women for positions in his administration, and he has joined forces with the religious right to curtail women’s rights by signing legislation that makes it harder for vulnerable women in developing countries to get birth control.

I hope this clarifies my reasoning for calling Trump a fascist. It is not simply the president’s disdain for the constitution and use of authoritarian tactics that leads me to call Trump a fascist. Rather, it is his entire overarching ideology, worldview, and policies when compared to those of fascist regimes of the past. While there are many disagreements between left libertarians and right libertarians, I hope that we can all agree that opposing fascism is of the utmost importance.",1596078821.0
133,Do NOT waste vote .,221,ibfa4l,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/ibfa4l/do_not_waste_your_vote/,391,"If you are a libertarian, you should vote libertarian. 

If you are not in a swing state, you have no reason not to vote libertarian. 

If you are in a swing state. “They” will absolutely 100% notice you voted libertarian, not for them. That’s 2 things. You voted. And Not for them. 

True story. A district in Texas got gerrymandered so that a tiny sliver of land got extended waaay out of the way to a politicians house so that he was part of the district and could run. 

That’s how gerrymandering works. They know the zip codes, they know the exact address, of every regular voter, and they rig elections accordingly. 

This means something HUGE. Just by being a libertarian, and voting in your own interests, you ALSO fight the major method of election rigging. 

But that’s just the beginning. You also give pause to extremist talking points. Shotgun Joe wants AR-15’s banned? Pussy grabber is all about the bible now? That doesn’t sound like them at all. Because it isn’t. Talking points are measured assets that get small but passionate subgroups interested. The majority of the left does not want to ban firearms, and the majority of the right is pro scientifically evidence based gun control. But EXTREMISTs on both ends will vote JUST on those pathos issues. 

When you vote libertarian, you give politicians pause before they commit to extremist talking points. They will try to assimilate your vote, because they will see you as in the middle, but voting, and try not to turn you away. 

And one more huge reason if the previous huge reasons weren’t enough for Libertarians to vote Libertarian.

192,Who federal agent detaining protester Portland ? The PACT Force,120,hutybk,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/hutybk/who_are_the_federal_agents_detaining_protesters/,70,"*Note - This is compilation of public available data about the PACT (Protect America's Communities Task) Force I've gathered over the past three days.*

Portland, Oregon has experienced an unprecedented level of [protests and protest-related vandalization and violence over the past 50+ days.](https://www.koin.com/news/protests/timeline-50-days-of-portland-protests/)The recent deployment of federal law enforcement agencies to Portland to ostensibly assist with protecting federal facilities surrounded by the protests, but they were observed [picking up and detaining people in unmarked vehicles](https://www.opb.org/news/article/federal-law-enforcement-unmarked-vehicles-portland-protesters/) while wearing masks to prevent identification.

## So, who are the PACT Force?

On June 26, 2020, President Trump issued the [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-protecting-american-monuments-memorials-statues-combating-recent-criminal-violence/) on Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Violence in response to removal of statues by protesters and other acts of vandalism across the country.  Among the E.O. is Section 5, which states, “Upon the request of the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the Administrator of General Services, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, **personnel to assist with the protection of Federal monuments, memorials, statues, or property**.”

On July 1, 2020, the **Department of Homeland Securit**y, in compliance with the aforementioned E.O., [announced the formation](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/07/01/dhs-announces-new-task-force-protect-american-monuments-memorials-and-statues?fbclid=IwAR3EA0Blzgw4JHRkasGseud8ZDtKVM8_p_nIaLAE18OIRe0HzilQwKpi6vw) of the **Protect American Communities Task Force (PACT)** to “... coordinate Departmental law enforcement agency assets in protecting our nation’s historic monuments, memorials, statues, and federal facilities.” At the time of the announcement, it was not stated what duties or departments would be involved in this task force, but that has since come to light in Portland.

After a [video surfaced](https://twitter.com/SenJeffMerkley/status/1283852273089683464) of an individual being detained by masked agents in camouflage, along with [interviews by Oregon Public Broadcasting journalists of several more instances](https://www.opb.org/news/article/federal-law-enforcement-unmarked-vehicles-portland-protesters/), the agents were identified as **Customs and Border Patrol** agents, [confirmed by CBP in a statement](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/speeches-and-statements/statement-cbp-response-portland-oregon) on July 17. CBP states, “The **Federal Protective Service** (FPS) is the lead government agency that CBP personnel are supporting. CBP personnel have been deployed to Portland in direct support of the Presidential Executive Order and the newly established DHS Protecting American Communities Task Force (PACT)."" [The Nation magazine released](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/border-patrol-portland-arrest/) images of a CBP “Public Affairs Guidance” memo that details more information about CBP’s involvement with the PACT Force.

In an [NPR interview with DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/17/892393079/dhs-official-on-reports-of-federal-officers-detaining-protesters-in-portland-ore), he stated that, “... the federal courthouse there (Portland) is protected by **Federal Protective Services**, who are being supported by both **CBP** and **ICE** officers and - because of the violence there and the graffiti”, adding, “... as long as people continue to be violent and to destroy property that we will attempt to identify those folks. **We will pick them up in front of the courthouse. If we spot them elsewhere, we will pick them up elsewhere**.” Cuccinelli justifies picking up suspects away from the immediate area of federal property, stating, “The legal justification is that they are people suspected of damaging or attacking federal personnel or property. That's the justification. That's the basis for jurisdiction.”

[Oregon Public Broadcasting adds that the U.S. Marshal Special Operations Group](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2020/07/oregons-congressional-delegation-portland-demonstrator-wounded-by-us-marshals-service-tactical-unit-member.html) is also present in Portland, with the U.S. Marshals Service releasing a statement stating that it would, “continue to investigate, arrest and prosecute those persons instigating or involved in riots, looting and other violence against persons and property involving the violation of federal law.”

## What are the duties of the various agencies involved in PACT?

The PACT Force was formed at the direction of the **Department of Homeland Security**, the overarching agency created in 2002 during the Bush administration that reorganized many domestic federal agencies under a common office to address the threat of terrorism on American soil. It formed the PACT force and serves as the coordinating agency, along with the Departments of Justice and Interior.

**Federal Protective Service** is [tasked](https://www.dhs.gov/fps-what-we-do-fps-services) with the prevention and protection of Federal properties across the United States from criminal acts, terrorism, and other hazards. According to a [statement released by FPS](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/07/05/fps-statement-portland-civil-unrest), in Portland the “Officers from the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Marshals Service continue to defend federal property from criminal acts of violence and vandalism.”

**Customs and Border Patrol,** is responsible for policing the border at all U.S. territories. According the [their website](https://www.cbp.gov/about), they “takes a comprehensive approach to border management and control, combining customs, immigration, border security, and agricultural protection into one coordinated and supportive activity.” CBP has broad authority within the US, with [the ACLU noting that CBP jurisdiction extends 100 miles+ inland](https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone) from any point of the U.S. border, warning that “The Border Patrol often ignores this regulation and, aside from limiting interior checkpoint locations to within the 100-mile zone, rejects any geographic limitation on agents' authority. At least two federal circuit courts condone Border Patrol operations outside the 100-mile zone, federal regulations and Supreme Court precedent notwithstanding.”

**Immigration and Customs Enforcement** is mainly responsible for Enforcement and Removal of suspects who have violated U.S. immigration law, in addition to Homeland Security Investigations to investigate cross border criminal activity, according to the [agency’s website](https://www.ice.gov/about).

**U.S. Marshals Service,** unlike the other agencies mentioned above, is not under DHS, but the Department of Justice. According to [their factsheet](https://www.usmarshals.gov/duties/factsheets/overview.pdf), the Marshals’ duties include “protecting the federal judiciary, apprehending federal fugitives, managing and selling seized assets acquired by criminals through illegal activities, housing and transporting federal prisoners and operating the Witness Security Program.”

## What does this mean for protests in Portland and the future?

Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblaum has announced her office will sue over the actions of federal law enforcement agencies, [according to The Oregonian](https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/07/oregon-will-sue-federal-police-agencies-open-criminal-investigation-into-use-of-force.html). Additionally, House Judiciary Committee member Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi), and House Committee on Oversight and Reform Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) have filed a notice for investigation of the PACT Force’s actions in Portland.

Trump, for his part, has all but openly stated that he intends to expand the program, stating that “Portland was totally out of control, the Democrats, the liberal Democrats running the place have no idea what they’re doing”. When asked by reporters what he was planning to do about the uptick in violence, [he replied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdxGifv6a7A) “Well, I’m gonna do something, that I could tell you, because we’re not gonna let New York and Chicago and Philadelphia, Detroit, and Baltimore, ... Oakland is a mess” and promising “More federal law enforcement”.",1595308548.0

For example, the [open market operations tab](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_openmarketops.htm) and crises response, which should be a ticker type style of data, instead reads like a history lesson focusing on 2008-2013 instead of the 2.3 trillion they just pumped into the market last quarter.

While I don't necessarily agree with the ideals of libertarianism I can respect the views and where they are coming from and why they want what they want.

However, even though I'm sure many of you know this, I feel there is a cancerous growth in your party. Conservatism is bleeding over to you. People who are die hard Republican but the taint of supporting Trump is too much for them to handle as an identity.

I have a few friends and family who have identified as libertarian but their underlying beliefs are so hard core Trump and anti everything else it's painted the libertarian views as just being Republican views without the label of bigotry. Even worse though is because these people are vocal about their hatred it starts to skew views and make people think this is a common belief among the Libertarian party.

I hope you find a way to your rid yourselves of this because a dominate alternative 3rd party that isn't ride with corruption or hatred would be a welcome relief to the country and could present more civil dialogue.

267,PSA : Always remember statistic reading news -- small number example large pool people/events tell nothing .,83,i76h29,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/i76h29/psa_always_remember_statistics_when_reading_the/,42,"There are certain news story types you often see, usually because they're pretty easy content to make, that tell you effectively nothing.  You can find these stories at any politics or news subreddit, and from pretty much every outlet from the *New York Times* to patriotgodfreedomnews.com.  These are stories that \*seem\* like they say something, but actually say virtually nothing. This is not at all an exhaustive list:

**""Scientists say""/""Activists say""/""Republican politicians say"" etc.**

Remember how plurals work; they just mean ""more than one.""  When you see a story that says something like ""Scientists Believe Avocados May Cure Cancer,"" or whatever, always remember that just means ""More than one scientist thinks avocados may cure cancer,"" not ""all of the scientists.""  There are million of scientists in the world, just like there are millions of activists and thousands of Republican officials.  These stories only have real significance if they're talking about *a general professional consensus*, or the individuals they focus on are prominent or influential in their field.

**""A few members of a large group did something horrible""**

You see this in all kinds of contexts.  There is a r/bestof post right now listing out politicians convicted of sex crimes.  It means nothing.  There are tens of thousands of elected public officials in America, and hundreds of thousands have served over the course of the last couple decades, just based on law of averages hundreds of these people will be sex offenders.  Likewise if you grant early release to 500,000 inmates, even if that group has become substantially more law abiding than the general public you'd still expect someone in that group to commit murder.  We are a big fucking country, every major interest group, every major political party, every major profession, etc. has hundreds of thousands if not millions of people, so you can always find terrible examples in these pools.

**""Look at this crazy shit someone said on Twitter""**

This is the laziest.  If you see any story trying to draw broad conclusions from what random people said on the Internet, downvote and move on.  There are billions of people on FaceBook and Twitter.  If you look hard enough you can find any viewpoint imaginable.  Unless the speaker is particularly prominent such that their personal comments are news in their own right, or the story includes broad data analysis, it's not worth your time.

Corollary:

The above logic also applies to a common argument style on the Internet, where people match example for example.  If Bob did ""X"" bad thing 200 times, and Carl did ""X"" 10 times, any rational person would understand Carl to be much better than Bob on the issue of doing ""X.""   But in an argument, if someone brings up a specific example of Bob doing ""X"", someone defending Bob can probably match it with a specific example from Carl, tit for tat, and keep doing so until both are bored with the conversation (or, more likely, derailed onto another topic).  This makes nobody more informed.

Anyway, feel free to add your own examples.",1597100642.0

I frequent this sub from time to time get an opposing view of current news. R/conservative was always the most useless waste of my time to look at a different pov. If it was a criticism of trump it was always shut down no matter how valid it may have been. Last 4 years had been tough for me. 

I want to come clean that since the portland protests, and trump’s latest tweet about delaying elections, this sub has really gone out of its way to show me that they do not have an allegiance to no party and no president. They only have allegiance to the flag of these united states and it’s people. They only have allegiance to the strict ideals that they adhere to.

Police violence escalated right after the falsified presidential elections (in which Lukashenko of course ""won""), when people went in the streets to peacefully protest. Tear gas, flashbangs, rubber bullets, deployed military vehicles, especially in the capital, Minsk, and severe beatings were used against the protesters almost instantly, and there were already many severe injuries and several dead protesters (one was ran over by a police van) during these days of unrest.  Everyone is targeted, including journalists - cops don't care. The government is also trying to shut down the Internet, and it's almost unworkable for the past 3 days. This is the largest uprising in the modern history of Belarus, which has been under Lukashenko's dictatorship for the last 26 years. Of course, people are becoming angrier, and start learning from other protests (like in Hong Kong), and many workers from state-owned factories went on strikes today.

The libertarian movement in Belarus is very small, but it's still there

**The police do not have probable cause to arrest you just because you are standing near someone else who may have committed a crime.** 

We’ve all heard the saying that people shouldn’t be treated as “guilty by association.” Well, that’s also the law. To wit, Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 91 (1979).

And the unmarked van accident was an arrest. The legal precedence here is Dunaway v. New York, 442 U.S. 200 (1979), where the Supreme Court considered whether the police violated the Fourth Amendment when, without probable cause, they took someone ""into custody, transported him to the police station, and detained him there for interrogation.""

Just as in Dunaway, this man was ""taken"" from the street ""where he was found,"" put into ""a police car"" (sorta), ""transported to a police station"" (inside the courthouse), ""and placed in an interrogation room,"" where he was questioned.",1595453728.0

I look at their account, and they share a general few qualities:

-Most often their comments are rude, to the point where they insult rather than trying to get to the debate

-They are in favor of the state controlling whatever issue is at hand

-They will making mocking comments towards a serious issue. For example I've seen both ""Protester killed"" and ""Officer murdered"" laughed at and justified

-They are in favor of banning ideology that offends them

Now, as for the previous point, I'm very happy we are a subreddit that does not censor allowing discussion of many different ideas. I'm not sure if these people genuinely think they are libertarian, or if they just want to do their best to silence/spread doubt in our community.

I recommend not responding to those first few comments that are written with an uncomfortable aggressiveness, but do think about what you would say to someone trying to spread that hate.

I personally believe as long as the government is not using the area reserved for parks for any other use, there should not be a problem with it preserving certain swaths of land, within reason. I do believe that the authority of these parks should mostly be going to the states and local communities, but this is one area in which I think government actually does its job, especially considering its constitutional role to protect life.",1596105024.0

I have noticed when talking to left leaning people, that when they think of Libertarians and Libertarianism, they dont think of *us,* as in Libertarian subreddits or people who have actual libertarian beliefs.

Many times a left wing person will describe what they think to be a ""libertarian"" and in doing so perfectly describe the modern day Republicans.

The Republicans that wave the gadsden flag, and then turn around and stomp over the rights of LGBT people because they disagree, or other religions, even other political affiliations. These people outwardly say they are Libertarians or lean Libertarian, then are openly racist, homophobic, etc. and still vote Red no matter what. They are destroying our image and a part of why people think we are a joke.

And the worst part is, they are allowed to so it, as they should be of course. This just makes it not only much harder, but much more pertinent for us to get our ACTUAL Libertarian views out into the forefront If they ask where Libertarians have been on the issue of government overreach, show them the proof that we have been there from the beginning. Thay we have been pushing for the demilitarization of the police since we were founded.

I decided to scroll through r/conservatives today (for whatever reason) and saw a post with a quote from Candace Owens regarding how the democrats are stupid for trying to enforce a lockdown when the coronavirus death rate is only “99.96%”. I commented asking how they could simply shrug off the deaths off so many people just because they were in a low percentage and was permanently banned and muted for asking “What’s wrong with you people?”. I truly don’t get the conservatives of that sub. I’d never explored political subs too much before, and mostly figured that the insane conservatives I’d see online/in the news were of a select few who were the worst of the worst. I figured that the general majority of conservatives must have at least *some* common sense about coronavirus, but upon looking at r/conservatives, I really can’t find any. It’s just so weird to me how these people can truly believe things like that masks suffocate you and that the death rate is low so we should all just picked up and return to work. I understand that at least one person in the world is bound to have a different outlook on a topic, but it’s just really shocking to think that so many can find one thing that seems absolutely insane to me (and many others) so absolutely fine.

My frustration though is the use of it. This flag with its history has (at least in my area) been pushed off and used as simply a flag for gun rights. And ironically many of the people I've talked to have little to no clue how deep and amazing this flag is, simply saying it stands for their 2nd amendment and use to be a flag of the marines. And ironically too the same people I've talked to seem very supportive and encouraging of excessive police and military spending as well as whooping and hollering in celebration when I have shown police force using excessive and even potentially fatal force.

Trump is apparently moving forward with his EO to regulate social media.  

Here's a primer on section 230, it's really boring but I'll give you the jist of it.

https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/06/08/a-primer-on-section-230-and-trumps-executive-order/

Essentially in 90s, Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co. found that an online service was liable for information on their services on the basis that they moderated their pages. 

(Also, yes it's *that* Stratton Oakmont from the DiCaprio film). 

This was preceded by a prior case, Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc. , that had established Compuserve to not be at fault because they provided no moderation to their service. 

So the courts had, based on current laws, established that a website must choose : 

- moderate and be liable for anything slipping through the cracks

- no moderation whatsoever to avoid liability 

The Brookings institute identifies the most relevant portions of law here ; 

Section 230(c)(1) ; 

“No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”

Section 230(c)(2)  ;

“No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of—

(A)any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or

(B)any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1).”

This is the portion the President's EO targets ; 

>(A)any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or

First I would just say that ""otherwise objectionable"" is essentially applicable to anything. If I have a Star Wars forum I'd like to be able to remove Star Trek material. 

Second, nothing in this law requires the forum to be run in a ""neutral manner"" - if that were even a remotely feasible prospect. 

This EO empowers the government to decide if a platform meets their standards of neutrality, it does not then they can strip basic and sensible legal protections against slander and expose the company to uncontrollable liability. This would shut down big forums, and allow a biased government to give special protections to their favored forums.

So many of you are gonna bitch and piss and moan about how “masks are infringing on our rights” and “the liberals are gonna take away our guns” but the INSTANT people actually fucking nut up and start fighting the overtly tyrannical government for their rights you’re the first ones crying “but my pwivate pwoperty” “wiots awe never okay” “viowence isn’t the answer”

Wake the fuck up. You’ve been complaining about how we need to be scared of the government, skeptical of everything they do, and ready to fight back at a moments notice because if we don’t dig up tyranny by the roots before it takes hold it’ll be here forever. And you’ve been the laughingstock of the fucking country because of it. Always subjugated to third party, always talked about but never listened to.
And now that the police are overstepping their bounds, now that the government is sending in federal troops to suppress protests and incite violence, and now that they’re being blatantly and overtly tyrannical in nature you’re gonna bend down and lick their fucking boots? Because you’re scared of not having a police force? Because you don’t want black people to have rights? Because there’s so much hate in your bones that you can’t bring yourself to stand by your virtues in order to act in solidarity with your fellow American?

The libertarian answer to law enforcement HAS ALWAYS BEEN private security firms and utilizing of our second amendment rights.

The libertarian answer to government oppression HAS ALWAYS BEEN fight for your freedom.

Why do you fucking redpilled neets fucking sit and rage about gun rights if not to fight tyranny? That’s the reason for the 2nd amendment in the first fucking place?

Now obviously this isn’t everyone here. And I’d be very surprised if it was even the majority. But they are an extremely vocal minority. They are loud and obnoxious as all shit and it honestly makes me sick with rage when I see people willing to look the other way to spite their fellow American because of the color of their skin.

Idk what the point of this post was. Maybe it’s a call to action, maybe I’m just trying to test the waters and see how many people disagree with me, maybe it’s just to let off steam. But I’m angry.

Completely privately funded space flight just would not be profitable any time soon.

Never mind just how much risk there is involved in space flight, that the public already assumed for the past 50+ years via NASA and public funding.

So I guess SpaceX is a crony capitalist’s wet dream:

Socialize the risk, privatize the profit.

If there hadn’t been 50+ years of public funding to prop it up, SpaceX wouldn’t exist. It would just not be profitable enough, and it would NEVER be able to acquire the needed private funding, because there would be WAY too much risk, with not enough reward.

523,Non-American libertarian observation regarding protest Portland,36,hzgaty,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/hzgaty/nonamerican_libertarian_observation_regarding/,87,"I've been monitoring the situation with police violence in Portland and libertarian reactions to it for the past several days, and the culturally conservative crowd has embarrasingly bad and silly opinions about it because ""the protesters are not libertarians, I don't care"". It almost seems like some American libertarians are completely alien to protests and don't understand their nature at all. Moreover, they seem to be unaware of the implications of downplaying police violence against people of different political views, even if (some) are Marxists. 

If you think that supporting or downplaying these events is fine, then you might as well be indifferent to almost all state violence, because (surprise surprise) the amount of people on Earth being libertarians is less than 1%. Most have views that at some point imply violence. By this account, such right-libertarians should have zero problems with antifa confronting neonazis, fascists and alt-right because their views imply violence and are not libertarian. Whoops, that doesn't happen for some magical reason.
There're 2 choices you face after realizing that fact. 
1) Basically declare war on most of humanity for non-libertarian views and support/downplay state violence against them.
2) Turn your brain on and think about tactics for once.

Of course, the types of people complaining about ""Marxist revolution"" in the US (Jesus Christ) are never consistent in their views. They'll write threads and articles about supposed Marxism but will say nothing about neonazi gangs murdering people despite all the research on them done by, you guessed it, antifa, for respectable organizations like Bellingcat, among others. They'll never furiously tweet that they don't care about cops killing conservatives, or alt-right, or whoever else despite their being not libertarians. There's a significant right-wing bias at play here. Their ""principled libertarianism"" is selective. It just so happens that their insistence on not helping people getting beaten up by cops turns on only when the protesters express something considered even remotely left-wing (like anti-racism, lol). Divide-and-conquer strategy works perfectly fine on such libertarians.

It's also ridiculous how one-sided all of these criticisms of Portland are. Do you remember right-libertarians complaining about Hong-Kong protests despite them being not really ""peaceful"" and despite some property being damaged and despite occasional street fights, even involving innocent people? Me neither. Guess why? Because there's no easy scapegoat in Hong-Kong, no ""anarchists"" or ""antifa"" or ""Marxists"" or whatever to blame for everything. Or do you remember right-libertarians complaining about the American revolution? America was founded on a riot. The bias should be clear here. Also, here's a newsflash: consistent libertarians don't view the state as legitimate, including state claims on property, and including the institution of police. So stop whining about a federal building being graffitied and about people standing up to police violence. It's the most libertarian thing you can do.

On the contrary, Russian libertarians understand this better. They supported anarchists and antifascists when they were brutally tortured to half-death condition by FSB, Jehovah's Witnesses when they were kidnapped and electrocutted by cops. They suported all victims of state repression - liberals, communists, nationalists. Civil society in Russia is united against the state regardless of political views, because nothing about them matters in the face of brutal, authoritarian repression. The boot will stomp you regardless of what principles you believe. Many American libertarians lack such understanding, don't seem to attend protests and ultimately do nothing except for whining on twitter. 

""But the protesters aren't libertarians and they hate me!"". Well maybe they hate you because you're reactionary trash and support ""unleashing the cops"" on them or at least don't even care neither about them, nor about the expansion of police state. And no, they don't need your ""help"", they're just pointing out your hypocrisy. Do you seriously think that people who engage in black bloc tactics and open confrontation with armed police risking their health and lives, need any help from some Internet hoppean trolls? You're useless, everyone knows that.

I will never ever think about equating the protesters with cops for their views. There're literal moms in Portland forming lines against the feds, and some dumb right-libertarians tweet about ""two rival gangs of Marxists and cops"" fighting here, for god's sake. If you shut yourself from the world because it's not libertarian enough, you'll never achieve anything. Why not talk to protesters about solutions to state violence and stand up in line with them? Some boogaloo boys seem to be doing that just fine. Of course, this question is tactical and there're always limits to alliances. What happened in Italy between bakunists, neofascists and nazi-maoists certainly didn't lead to awesome consequences (read up on the battle of Valle Giulia and the Years of Lead). But that just emphasizes the complexity of the problem of protests and the impossibility of just throwing it away. Think about that.

Ultimately, described opinions about protests appear due to lack of information. The protesters are viewed as a homogenous body, not a complex network of different people with various political opinions about issues. There's something uniting them though - resistance to cops. It's pretty funny that the same people preaching ""methodological individualism"" quickly throw it into the trash bin when the issue at question is political protest that contains people they don't like. This is no different from any state propaganda declaring protesters ""paid foreign agents"" or ""violent radicals"" or something. Though maybe it ultimately doesn't matter because your average right-libertarian can't make a difference between a normie liberal and Stalin, between VOX journalists and Mao. They're all the same vague ""left"", and everybody who values White Christian Western Civilization ought to hate ""the left"" whatever that means, correct?

I'm writing all this as a person from a country with hundreds of thousands, millions of open tankies, with many orthodox Marxists in academia and a communist party as part of the parliament. There's no ""Marxist revolution"" in the US, not even close. There're mostly normal people worrying about issues like racism, not a secret ""cultural Marxist"" conspiracy.

Despite all that, I've seen also good responses (including this sub, surprisingly decent for the most time), my criticism is not aimed at them. People associated with C4SS were very consistent on the protests, or Vermin Supreme, or many decent members of the LP and some people from libertarian academia. To them I send my admiration. But there're many right-libertarians and social media ""influencers"" (like Tom Woods and the like) who seemingly hate the vague left and protesters more than police violence. LP is heavily criticised for ""leftism"", of all organizations. This whole situation about Portland protests is a really good example of what having a reduced circle of care means. Or what the inability to distinguish between anarchists, liberals and tankies (almost non-existent in the US) means. Go into a comment section under a random conservative or right-libertarian tweet about Portland and witness tons of people expressing desire to murder protesters with live rounds. It's bloodthirst, they only care about defeating ""leftism"", not strict ideological distinctions.

I hope to witness libertarians understand this at some time. I want them to think about tactics and eliminate their pro-right-wing biases. I want them to stop forming opinions solely by reading alt-right pseudojournalists like Andy Ngo and conservative newspapers and stop being hypocritical. It seems to me that US libertarians are ""spoiled"" by living in a relatively ""free"" country. Most freedoms they take for granted are unavailable to many outside of the US. If you think that you can sit in your basement, ignore protests and enjoy your free speech without facing brutal repression, torture, police raids in the early morning and jail - you're a blind person, and your ""freedom"" will not last for long.",1595977641.0

1943 America First Party was an anti-Semitic party, Christian nationalist party. The party was then changed to an organization called ""The Christian nationalist Crusade"". Which then became against race mixing and immigration.


History of ""America First Committee""


The America First Committee was created 1940, as a non-interventionist movement that was against America joining WW2. It was a large membership with over 800,000 people. 


You may ask, ""what is the issue with a non-interventionist"" movement? Well let's hear the spokesperson reasoning for being non-interventionist.


Charles Lindbergh - ""It is not difficult to understand why Jewish people desire the overthrow of Nazi Germany. The persecution they suffered in Germany would be sufficient to make bitter enemies of any race. No person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution the Jewish race suffered in Germany. But no person of honesty and vision can look on **their pro-war policy** here today without seeing the dangers involved in such a policy, both for us and for them. Instead of agitating for war the Jewish groups in this country should be opposing it in every possible way, for they will be among the first to feel its consequences. Tolerance is a virtue that depends upon peace and strength. History shows that it cannot survive war and devastation. A few farsighted Jewish people realize this and stand opposed to intervention. But the majority still do not. **Their greatest danger to this country lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio, and our government**.""


TLDR; He's saying beating Nazi Germany would only benefit the Jews, and he says that the greatest danger in America is the Jewish influence in the nation.


There's more!


 ""America First"", was actually a slogan used by the KKK in the 1920s! Which is pretty early on in the slogans timeline.


So if saying ""Black Lives Matter"" makes someone a Communist, but saying ""America First"" doesn't make someone a fascist, then maybe you're a hypocrite!


You see how ridiculous this is? It's almost like a movement or even a phrase doesn't have be directly connected to the organization? 

Or maybe that would be thinking too logically?

The amount of damage unreasonable, anti-scientific and irresponsible people do to libertarianism is incalculable.

Should you have the ""right"" to be a nihilistic idiot towards the safety of others during a deadly global pandemic because doing the bare fucking minimum of safety precautions to be a decent human and protect the weakest people in society is too much to ask? Sure, just like you should technically have the ""right"" to call a black person the N-word to their face, or do heroin naked on the public street in front of a daycare center...legally speaking.

Should libertarians tolerate or praise this behavior personally in any way, shape or form? Fuck no.

Idiots doing dangerous, unacceptable and stupid things and calling it freedom is devastating for the credibility of freedom advocates who tolerate it misguidedly . We can stand up for the right for them to not be prosecuted and simultaneously condemn the living hell out of the action itself.

Public mask compliance is the least of all evils compared to shutting down the economy or a higher death toll. We live in societies and there are externalities and conflicts of rights that don't fit neatly into libertarian philosophy.

Unfortunately these anti-mask idiots are not products of Enlightenment thinking, but instead retrograde, anti-scientific individuals who make the best case for authoritarians that people are too stupid, selfish and dangerous to be trusted to be free.

What I believe would be best: full libertarian at the federal level, but individual states would have a wide variety of different politics.

Imagine a state with really low tax, the other one has free healthcare, free education. Not only it would allow people to CHOOSE what is best for them, but it would also create some kind of competition between states.

Failure states can learn from successful one. Anything managed federaly is in my opinion just a big monopoly that not only doesnt care to improve, but also has no real world references on how to do it.  

Removing power from the federal government and giving it to the states or even cities, would in my opinion completely change for the better how society works. People would have more freedom in choosing what is best for them and there wouldn't be as much of a need to 'compromise' between ideologies.

Because lets admit it, libertarianism is amazing but its not for everyone. 

If I were to create a totally new country, this would probably be a thing that I would put on the constitution, a clear list of what the federal gov isnt allowed to manage. Especially anything related to healthcare, education, social security, and probably more. Federal gov would probably be limited to military, currency and international relations. 

Anyway, just curious to know your thoughts on this.


Edit: free at the point of consumption, obviously paid through taxes.

One of the great things about the US is that ""democracy"" is baked into our culture. We can criticize one-party states like China, Iran, and God knows whatever Latin American flavor of the month.  But the problem with the traditional voting system is that it leads to either a bi-opoly (essentially the US now) or a defacto one party state.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting

Ranked Voting tries to reduce that.  The bi-opoly of the US lead to the horrible choice in 2016 of having to pick between Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.  This years choice between Biden and Trump doesn't seem much better.   There are probably a lot of ""Never Trumpers"" who would gladly vote for someone like Mitt Romney as well as ""Bernie Bros"" who would vote for Bernie if they weren't feeling as if they weren't pissing away their vote.

I am now wearing a mask everywhere, partially because most places mandate it’s but I also believe it could be a NAP violation to give someone the virus. 

Half of me says this can’t be. You cannot protect against everything and there must be some level of violence or intentionality to have a NAP violation. But maybe not? Maybe accidents are also NAP violations. And of course, you can debate whether or not a mask actually does anything, but if it does, and you don’t wear one, I feel like you are in violation of what we hold so dear.

So where's the Sheriff of Portland's county?

I see the mayor and governor and city council members are all decrying the situation, and ASKING Trump to withdraw those Federal agents.

Regarding the current US president, Donald Trump, I have seen a consensus on this Sub and American libertarianism as a whole about him being clearly a rather deplorable president for the US, which I agree by personally seeing him as nothing more than a nationalist populist who believes in protectionist policies and appears to have the objective of dividing the population just like any populist would do. 
On the other hand, Argentinian libertarianism sees him as a great leader, probably due to the fact that our government implements so many anti free market and anti entrepreneurship policies that we see Trump or even Bolsonaro as example of the type of leader that we currently need in our country.

Now, to what confused me the most about this sub is not the slight leftist libertarian (who I suppose are in favor a freer market with less regulation and taxes) but the straight out socialist libertarianism that I have seen here, this idea of liberty but without economic liberty, personal property but no private property. This people are straight out against capitalism yet they call themselves libertarians, when it turns out capitalism as a an economic system is the freest one. Or is it just that us libertarians tend to be against our country system? Because I know the US for being a clear example of capitalism when it comes to it's economy, same goes for most of the European and Escandinavian countries which contrary to the US have more public service with free healthcare being the main difference.

As a summary, I find it weird that we discuss capitalism as good or bad economic system in a libertarian sub, when in my eyes it is clearly the one that represents freedom the most.

I'm open to any civil discussions and I'm totally open to have my mind changed, as I believe myself to be rather ignorant of the American libertarianism.

720,Yet another gatekeeping post,24,hwxuuk,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/hwxuuk/yet_another_gatekeeping_post/,21,"I normally roll my eyes at these kinds of posts. After all, it’s pretty much impossible to distill a person’s whole ideology down to a single political issue or person. Someone can be strongly libertarian and only support Trump for his anti-regulation stances….I guess? But the events of the past few weeks have drawn a fundamental dividing line between ideologies. I’ve tried my best to rationalize and empathize with the other side, to find the absolute kindest interpretation of their views, but it’s just irreconciable—

If you support Trump’s actions this week, then you **fundamentally cannot be a Libertarian**.

Sure, maybe you like our positions on economic policy, or anti-interventionism, or maybe you’re just a gun nut. We welcome your support in these issues and are only too happy to accept the resultant increase in political capital. But if you EVER support the kinds of actions taken by Trump against his own people, then you don't understand the key tenants of our ideology. All those cute little platitudes you’ve parroted these last few years— “those who sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither”, “it’s better that 100 guilty persons escape justice than one innocent be falsely accused”, etc—those actually *mean* something to us. They're not just pithy quotes used to get you out of actually making a coherent point; they form the basis of a moral and political philosophy.

For argument’s sake, let’s accept your most rabid anti-protester paranoia: that these are “radical anarchists” filled with “ANTIFA fighters” recruited from the ""swarms"" of “illegal immigrants” dedicated to burning cities and destroying property. Even *if* that were true (which it's obviously not), Trump is still guilty of violating their (and our) rights. He has sent a paramilitary force under his personal authority as President explicitly for the purpose of assaulting and detaining American civilians without warrants and without the support of the local government. The forces themselves are pulled from Border Control and similar agencies, so obviously lack the training to make determinations of probable cause. The acting Homeland Security chief has described his people’s actions as “proactive” arrests; do I even need to explain that one? These aren't just points of legal minutia meant to clear the protesters based on technicalities; they form some of our most basic rights, as elucidated by our Constitution:

>The First Amendment clarifies the people’s the right to peaceably assemble; if one peaceful protester is detained, it has been violated  
>  
>The Second Amendment codifies our right to bear arms, and bearing arms cannot itself be punished by law; if one person has been “proactively” detained for holding a “weapon” like a brick or a bottle, it has been violated  
>  
>The Fourth Amendment protects us from unreasonable search and seizure; if one person has been detained without due process, without a criminal charge, or without a person present who can officially determine probable cause, even if they’re literally on the verge of committing vandalism, it has been violated  
>  
>The Tenth Amendment explicitly limits the rights of the government—and thus the President— to those listed in the Constitution. By assembling and activating a paramilitary group under his personal authority to bring into effect an executive order signed at his own whim, Trump has violated it.

And that’s just from the Bill of Rights. We could go into a whole discussion about legal precedent and basic moral precepts, but by now that’d be extremely redundant. So I say again:

In this story, a woman infected 16 people in her household by not telling them that she had tested positive. This is a question for more than the current pandemic; if a person **knows that they can spread a disease** (not dealing with asymptomatic spread), should they be held accountable for not telling those close to them? 

This isn’t about wearing a mask outdoors, or anything in public. Do you believe that there should be a legal responsibility to share this information with those in her household? Does this violate the NAP?

I literally just posted this and I would already change the title if I could. No, she wasn’t coughing on people intentionally, so the title goes a bit far. However, she didn’t give her housemates any reason to believe they should be cautious of being around her.",1595460382.0

If you’re planning on voting for one of the candidates above instead of JoJo, the only possible reasons that I can think of are:

1. You live in a swing state and prefer your vote goes to the “lesser evil.”
2. You don’t live in a swing state, but you still can’t live w the slightest chance that one of DT & JB win, so you still end up voting for the “lesser evil.”
3. You’re actually a closeted Dem/Rep. 

Obviously my reasons above are pretty general and don’t go into detail why one is considered the “lesser evil.” Please elaborate if you care to. I just want to better understand why some of you will be voting for the two popular candidates rather than JoJo.

Abortion can’t possibly be a violation of the NAP, because preventing a woman from terminating her own pregnancy is an even more direct violation of the NAP. 

1) A woman has a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Forcing a woman to live with a child she doesn’t want is directly violating all 3 of those principals. 

2) A woman has the right to self defense. Even if you consider a fetus to be a human life, a woman would still have the ability to use abortion as a self-defense mechanism to protect her emotional, physical, and financial well-being. 

3) Abortion is actually protecting the “life” of the child in many cases such as when it would be born into abject poverty, drug addiction, a life of birth defect and other medical deformity, etc

4) There can be no human life lost if there was never going to be a human life to begin with. In the case of when a pregnant woman was murdered it of course makes sense that there would be two charges. Since she intended to birth that child and it’s assumed a healthy birth. In this case there could be no such thing because the woman chose to not have a child and there will be no life. Digging a seed is not chopping a tree, and cooking an egg is not eating chicken.",1596853404.0

If y’all actually thought bOtH sIdEs were eQuALLy as, if we sampled 1000 members of the both sides brigade, and forced them to choose between Dems or GOP, there should be roughly a 50/50 distribution.

They want to turn us into a Theocracy, the same one Iran was turned into with a radical Islamic theocracy in 1979. 

Radical Christianity is a huge problem in America which few people fail to address. The Puritans escaped Britain because they were radical and the British wanted to punish them for it. So they came to America and they advocate for Circumcision (which today is only done in America and the Middle East) to prevent masterbaution, a higher drinking and smoking age, a war on drugs, etc, etc. Radical Christianity is destroying America because of the Republican party, which has these lunatics in power.

Christianity is beautiful, very peaceful religion but the Puritan sect which is prevalent today in American culture is radical and disgusting. When we look over at the Christianity in Europe, we see no circumcision, we see a very low or nonexistent drinking and smoking age and no war on drugs.",1596339011.0

During a time of massive growth in any industry, there are near infinite opportunities for innovation, competition, and consolidation. Economies of scale are a great way to decrease costs, and, generally speaking, a valid way to best your competitors. 

But the growth in tech, tech stocks, social media, and the entire advertising world has brought us to an interesting place. After listening to the testimony and pondering the implications, I've come to realize just how much of our modern lives are dominated by tech and social media. Many of the business practices brought to light during the hearing reminded me of something straight out of the oil and railroad monopolies. 

In Russia you have an Oligarchy. In the US we have succumbed to a Datagarchy; whereby a tiny handful of very powerful individuals have near singular control over the data scraped from our internet lives. 

I've seen Libertarians struggle with notion that there could be some useful limitations (i.e. regulations) that could retard some of the distasteful affects of monopoly. 

As a Libertarian-leaning independent, I support choice and competition in *many* marketplaces, but for me it's not black and white. From a Libertarian perspective, should anything be done to insulate against

Why do libertarians not agree with doing that and instead rain down on a poorly funded campaign. I get it to a degree and it doesn't excuse certain views she might have, but Joe Biden and Trump have a history of being very, very shitty people. So it baffles me to hear a libertarian refuse to vote because of one subject where they don't align on a single issue or because she campaigns in a way that you don't like.

If we cannot forgive these little things and get over ourselves how could a libertarian perspective possibly win a person over when democrats and republicans have allegiance that supersedes seemingly all moral values the candidates should have.

I know y'all don't need the same level of convincing, but I hope you can use this argument in your own interactions, and give me feedback on the ideas herein.\*\*  


I bounce around between several of the gun-related subs, both liberal and (ahem) less liberal... and one constant I've seen on all of them is a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth among gun owners about feeling unrepresented. I've also seen a lot of people saying that a 3rd party vote is either wasted, or a vote for the other guy.

I'm not going to discuss the candidates here because, frankly, that would be repetitive, and I value your time. But it seems clear to me that people are approaching this issue of 3rd party voting with their hearts and not their heads. The key is understanding how the electoral college works and leveraging that knowledge with polling data to mitigate the risk of ""voting for the other guy.""

Because of the electoral college, whoever wins the popular vote in your state, even if it is just by 1%, gets ALL the electoral votes for that state (except for Maine and Nebraska... they're proportional).  
So...

If your preferred candidate is leading solidly in the polls IN YOUR STATE, vote for your candidate.  
If it's close, vote for your candidate.  
If you live in Maine or Nebraska, vote for your candidate.  
If the other guy is solidly ahead (and I mean by a \~10+ point spread), vote 3rd party.

That's it. Simple.  
This does require paying attention to the latest poll data from multiple sources and making an informed decision.... Alabama, Kentucky, Oklahoma, the Dakotas, West Virginia... y'all are going to be wasting your vote if you vote for Biden. New York, California, Washington, Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts... Same if you vote for Trump. Wasted. Instead of wasting it, why not send a message?

If everyone who is disgruntled about our choices follows this simple strategy, it'll have NO effect on the OUTCOME of the election, but it will have a huge impact with regard to the impact and the interpretation of that outcome by the 2 major parties, the media, and the rest of the electorate.

There's a quote that applies here. ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result."" The American Electorate has been voting for the 'lesser of two evils' for decades now, and this is where it has brought us.

Obviously, the Libertarians are the biggest 3rd party. You may not like some, or even most of their platform. I sure don't. Frankly, it doesn't matter, because Jojo isn't going to win. That's not even the goal here. The goal is to show the two main parties that we are onto them, and we're not putting up with their fuckery anymore.

If you can't bring yourself to vote Libertarian, that's OK! Vote Green or write in Bernie Sanders. But DON'T sit this one out, and don't throw away your vote on Biden or Trump if they are going to lose IN YOUR STATE.

So full disclosure here, I am socialist, not a Libertarian but I am asking this in good faith. I do not have any ""gotchya!"" type responses planned. But I am curious to know the libertarian approach to this.

I think it is totally fair to look at the tens of millions who died in the Great Leap Forward as the direct responsibility of the Chinese Communist Party and the Maoist system. It is also fair to look at the millions who died during Stalin's forced collectivization of Ukrainian agriculture as the fault of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Stalinism.

In a totalitarian society, in which the Party uses violence to make sure its directives, and only its directives, are followed by the people it seems reasonable to say the tragedies that happen on its watch, from homelessness to hunger, are its fault.

Now I work in marketing for non profit organizations involved in food distribution. Early in the industry I learned some pretty mind blowing statistics.

Did you know that \*HALF\* of all healthy, nutritious food produced in most first world countries like America is destroyed before it is eaten? For reasons ranging from inefficient logistics, retailer aversion to aesthetically displeasing produce and consumers not realizing ""best before"" is not ""unsafe to eat"", one in two meals are wasted.

At the same time, hunger is a serious problem in our countries, especially hunger among children. I read a report a few days ago (it might have been the CDC I don't recall) that 13 million American students will suffer academically because of under nutrition.

Now I have centrist and libertarian friends. When I ask them about whether they feel this is the result of the market economy I met with answers like ""well this is just the natural way things go."" 

My question is, why?

Why do these problems which arise in capitalist get to be considered above criticism?

The problems are decentralized, they may be the result of voluntary arrangements, but they do occur in Capitalist societies, why can I not look at those results, of mass hunger among children in an economy so gluttonous half of all food is thrown out, and say this is the result of capitalism?",1595891838.0

*Examples from history would be helpful.

#3) What rights do you expect a state have in this kind of event?

Note: Use of ""riot problem"" is for the sake of the argument, it does not have anything to do with anything happening in the real world right now, though similar events may be occouring. This is a thought exercise.

These are serious questions, I'm not looking for people to accuse others of their ""w0ke""ness or lack thereof.",1595814408.0
