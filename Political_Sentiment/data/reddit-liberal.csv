38,An open letter may vote 3rd party ......,596,i8frzl,Liberal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/i8frzl/an_open_letter_to_those_who_may_vote_3rd_party/,276,"  

Greetings Democrats, Liberals, Bernie Bros., etc., 

I wanted to take a moment to type an open letter from the heart about the upcoming election. As we know by now, Kamala Harris was selected to be Joe Biden’s running mate. While this is been seen as mostly positive news, there is a large enough segment of upset people out there on Twitterverse encouraging people to vote third party candidate, that I feel compelled to appeal to complete strangers, if nothing else, to get them to consider the ramifications of their vote. 

Let me say up front, I was not a fan of the prospect of Joe Biden being the nominee. He was not my first choice, nor was he my 2nd, 3rd, honestly, he was toward the bottom of the list. I was full on team Bernie. Joe Biden is about as exciting as dry oatmeal. And yes, I do believe Bernie Sanders was strong armed out of the election in both 2016 and 2018. In 2017, I left the Democratic party to NPA. I feel strongly I made the right decision.  After the announcement of Harris being the VP selection, I saw many people start saying they were going to vote for the Green Party candidate because he better represented their progressive views. I understand that, and I respect that mindset. In America, no one should “shame” another into voting for a preferred candidate…

However….

Before you vote for someone that isn’t Joe Biden, I just want you to keep one thing in mind: Whoever wins this election will fill the Supreme Court vacancy from Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She is tough as nails, but she is dying, and it’s very likely she’s not going to live for another 4 years. If Donald Trump wins re-election, he will fill that seat with a young, conservative jurist. It’s also likely Trump will fill at least one or two more seats on the Court as well. If that happens, it will cement a conservative majority. Any hope you have about Medicare for all, environmental protections, voting rights for felons, all that will be lost. In addition, you better believe that gay marriage, Roe V. Wade, legalized weed and civil rights protections will be gutted. Trump and McConnell aren’t even hiding the fact this is their endgame. This is exactly why they have put up with Trump’s crap the last 4 years. If we wait until 2024 and nominate someone like AOC, or another very progressive candidate, and they win, it won’t matter, because any proposed legislation will be struck down by the Supreme Court. 

America got it wrong in 2016, and it cost this country two seats on the Supreme Court to pave the way for a better future for us. I am very concerned we may be heading down this road again. For you liberals and progressives out there who aren’t thrilled about a Biden Presidency, I guess what I’m saying is perhaps we need to suffer with some dry oatmeal for a while to get to something better. If you have read this far, I thank you for reading, and I just ask that you really do some soul searching before voting third party.",1597274951.0

Trump is bad, like, beyond terrible. I myself am a fan of Bernie Sanders and will definitely be voting for him in the primary, and of course I will vote for just about anyone in the general election.

That being said, we need to focus on something that has been stated time and time again the last three years: Trump is a symptom of the problem, not the root. The root is two-sided: The U.S. government is not as invulnerable to corruption as many people like to believe (which means the Constitution itself needs revision), and Republican lawmakers (note, I'm not targeting their voters) have been more than happy to take advantage of this corruptible nature.

For this reason, the Left should be investing way more resources in Congressional races. If the Left takes control of Congress, we can A) block Judicial appointments in the case of a Trump victory, B) began pushing through legislative ground work for Constitutional change (even if it's vetoed at the top), and C) impeach AND CONVICT those who must be held accountable.

Also I'm crossposting this but can't figure out how to do it officially, sorry if that's annoying to anyone.

EDIT I: I really appreciate everyone's contribution to this discussion! To those who disagree with the strength of the stance I take in the title - honestly, you're right. To those who are pointing out the importance of all elections - you're also right! More than anything, I wanted to highlight that we ought to be diversifying our attention, and I don't see much discussion on this topic (I'm usually the first to bring it up in my circles, even though they tend to consider themselves politically savvy). All in all, get out the vote, and donate to Democrats opposing Republicans if you can! If you can't, talk about it!! Open up the conversation with those you know, spread the word, convince those who are on the fence!

EDIT II: Thank you stranger for the gilding - it's my first time ;)",1582157142.0

We have just rolled our eyes, shook our heads, and hoped that in due time people would start to come around to the fact that wealth should be used to build up humanity, not repress it.

Well they aren't coming around.  They have only gotten worse.  Turns out that whole ""libruls are terrorists"" talk wasn't just rhetoric.  They really see anyone who tries to disagree with them as an enemy to America... whatever they happen to think and feel at the time is what America stands for apparently.

The root word for Liberal is liberty, something conservatives have always claimed to stand for until now.  They have brazenly come out in favor of state funded military occupation of American cities... simply because they don't like the political beliefs of the people who live there.

These people are traitors.  Plain and simple.  They represent everything the American constitution was written to oppose.  They do not care about America.  They do not care about freedom or liberty.  They do not care about their fellow man.  They only care about causing pain and destruction to anyone who stands to oppose them.  

They are not going to change course.  We need to be taking this as seriously as they apparently have been for a while now.  They see us as a hostile invading force, well it's time to categorize them as the authoritarian occupying force they have turned themselves into.

The tactic of airing this on free local television will disproportionately reach the elderly, the uneducated, and people with a lack of access to the internet or lack of working knowledge of the internet who are unable to gather information that is counter to this stance. Sinclair is preying on a vulnerable demographic that has largely been unexposed to this conspiracy theory and it is abhorrent and harmful.

Not just voting for him b/c they are republican and that's their only option but still acknowledging that he's a dangerous fool, but like still being total fans of his, going to rallies, etc.

I'm a middle aged adult, my parents were very good to me throughout my life and helped me succeed in life. However they also were moderately racist and taught me this racist behavior was ok. Not Klan level racist, but using the N-word and always making fun of black people.

Now that I'm an adult and I'm married to a black woman, I really regret how I grew up, things that were said behind closed doors, and behaviors I grew up thinking were no big deal.  I'm angry at my parents over this and over still supporting this dangerous, ill-informed lunatic after all that we've seen the past four years.

The open racism sort of stopped after I got serious with my wife. But what happened in the past for many years eats away at me. With the amount of incompetence and corruption we've seen from trump at this point, I believe that the only reason anyone still supports him is because he's racist.

I stopped answering their calls a few months ago. My best friend also of 30 years (he's actually a democrat but extremely racist, more than my trumper parents).

I am conflicted but I resent them and I don't want to hear any of it ever again or have my wife hear any of it, which unfortunately she has already. I live a few thousand miles away from all of them now.",1595348554.0

That's fine, whatever, jesus saved my soul. But I told my grandma I voted for Obama and she said ""why would you put a monkey in the white house"". Like I get we come from different eras but I got really upset and shouted at her and then my immediate family kind of started to disown me for yelling at grandma. Apparently she was maybe developing dementia so I can understand that somewhat. 

But on another occasion I tried explaining transgenderism to my dad and he just looked at me really weirdly and said, ""well that ain't right"" and walked off. I followed him and told him how he was being disrespectful and closed minded and he just said something to the effect of, ""what the hell? Get outta here, lameo"" As someone who's gender fluid (but still in the gender closet) it really hurt me.

He's changed his tone!  He's realized how serious this is!  GASP! He's becoming a leader!!!!!!"" 

I'm literally sitting here on my couch screaming at my TV, SHAKING with anger,  ""He's not changed a damn thing!  He's a malignant narcissist,  and a sociopath, and they live off mimicking the emotions that match the moment!"" Why do you think so many people were infuriated at the hot mike moment after that whole Oval Office Address where he held his serious and ""presidential""demeanor until someone said ""okay you're good"". All appearance of seriousness literally melted away,  his face took on that constant almost flippantly snide expression that he supports perpetually,  and he slapped both his hands down in the desk and in a totally lighthearted tone said, ""Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!"" As though to say,  well that's out of the way, back to the golf course! So while I understand that we need leadership in this moment, I'll look to Pelosi, Schumer ,Dr. Fauci, and those people who who have consistently told their truth from day one. But these newscasters who sit there and ooze over Trump carrying on a news conference in a somewhat, kind of serious manner, much the same way I did with my toddler when by straight fluke she just happened to be standing over the training potty at just the right time to do her business, and yet by no stretch of the imagination did i even hope to think she was potty trained, I cannot even feel one iota of enthusiasm for anyone in this administration, because what Adam Schiff said still remains if not as true, even truer now when he asked the Senate why it was so important that they remove Trump from office in that moment instead of waiting for the coming election. ""You Cannot wait for the election because you cannot trust this president to do what is right for the people of this country and you know that this is true!"" And again, i point to the proof that Trump has already tried to poach the vaccine by buying the German lab that is closest to having one created.  Call me a bad American,  but I'll rally behind my fellow Americans, but I'll never, EVER support this man who has repeatedly pulled the rug out from under every one of us so many times now we have lost freaking count.  And before someone calls me unpatriotic,  it has nothing to do with patriotism.  It has to do with as one contributor put it this morning,  ""Lucy pulling the football out from in front of Charlie Brown one too many times"". In other words, fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  Fool us as many times as this jackass has and I just go straight back to how the HELL did he get in the White House in the first place? ! I'm done....

410,US Anti-Mask Conservatives Motivated Irrational Ignorant Machismo,208,htwriq,Liberal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/htwriq/us_antimask_conservatives_are_motivated_by/,65,"It may be hard to believe, but I am not cherry picking their reasoning here. It is representative of the answers I get on this subject.

Figuring Reddit had the best chance of meeting pro-mask conservatives, I posted in r/Conservative, which boasts 390k members.

My pro-mask post received 50% upvotes, for a score of zero. The [top comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ht34if/american_rightwingers_should_embrace_voluntary/fyf0alm/), by u/banjopicker, justifies the anti-mask position. My rebuttal to it was not published, indicating moderator agreement with Banjo. In the absence of anything better, I'm forced to take it seriously.

First, Banjopicker accuses me of being ""somewhat hysterical"", which is like calling someone ""somewhat enraged"": in other words, angry. It is true that I am irritated, disgusted, and disappointed. However, Banjopicker's insinuation that I am afflicted with a feminine irrational fear is false. Rather, his response reads as moronic machismo.

This is demonstrated in the very next line, wherein he bravely asserts: ""I won’t be tied to a mask over a 99.3% recovery rate."" That implies a .7% CFR, which, if it swept the USA, would kill 2.3 million, nearly doubling the yearly death rate of 2.8 million. For comparison, only 170k die of accidents, yet no one objects to seat belts and helmets.

Obligatory common sense clarification:  I'm not saying one must always wear the blue-white surgical mask. I wear a cycling neck gaiter in public and raise it when strangers might fear infection or around public hand surfaces.

Banjo next asserts, ""The significant majority has nothing to worry about."" This is true, assuming they do not care about any of the vulnerable elderly. Machismo or psychopathy? You decide. However, I fail to see how the elderly are supposed to quarantine themselves from asymptomatic carriers among the able-bodied young on whom they depend.

""This is largely a political power play,"" Banjo judges. Certainly, lockdown is a dramatic exercise of state power. Yet Banjo seems incapable of grasping that masks intrinsically favor the wearer in a political struggle. For example, masked state enforcers act with anonymous impunity. The same applies to masked dissidents, as Antifa know well. Which is why Hong Kong's government is trying to [ban protesters from wearing masks](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3092714/hong-kong-protests-top-court-hear-legal-challenge), an effort severely impeded by high citizen adherence to voluntary mask culture.

By ""power play,"" Banjo alludes to the split between pro-lockdown Democrats and anti-lockdown Republicans. The logical thing would be for Republicans to embrace masks to reduce hospitalizations, with empty beds shaming Democrats into lifting restrictions. But this chain of reasoning seems too complicated for the macho conservative amygdala, which can only muster an ""ignore, fight or flee"" trichotomous response. Since COVID19 is ""ignore"" and Democrats are ""fight"", the conservative cannot agree with Democrats on masks in order to better fight Democrats on lockdown by reducing COVID19's impact to negligible.

COVID19 can be stopped either by strong government or voluntary citizen anti-contagion measures, but taking no countermeasures leads to overwhelmed hospitals and morgues. The US government's countermeasures were delayed and ineffective, so it's up to the citizens. Conservatives are failing to pull their weight, which justly angers the portion of the population rational on the issue. Which leads to my last point:

>Banjo> the science is not conclusive on the capability of masks to protect you. For every article you post on the benefits, I can post a research paper that says the opposite.

This is more idiotic machismo. He boasts his citational prowess on an irrelevant point.

Coughing and sneezing [project sprays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnafrAtfMzE) of germ-laden saliva quite far. It is unquestionable that masks stop quite a lot of that spray, thereby reducing respiratory contagion.

Obviously a basic fabric mask can't compete with a hazmat suit. To point this out is asinine. The goal is to reduce the contagiousness of the overall pandemic, and reducing the range of respiratory droplet sprays does so admirably.

It would be just as idiotic to argue against handwashing during an epidemic because handwashing doesn't kill 100% of germs. It's identical logic. Here, I'll even link a research paper proving one shouldn't wash hands anymore:

from [The Effect of Handwashing with Water or Soap on Bacterial Contamination of Hands](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21318017/):

>Handwashing with plain soap and water reduced the presence of bacteria to 8%

Clearly handwashing is ineffective and a political power play backed by hysterical advocates!

I might be wrong in this, but i’ve always been a believer of condemn the action and not the person. Were in the midst of a time where people are cancelled regularly for something they did or said years ago (ie racism, bigotry, sexism, etc). I feel like this cancel culture era is creating an environment where people are not only told they should basically stop existing for something they said several years ago, but were also telling them that we don’t believe in their change and progress. I even look back and cringe at my past political stances, things i’ve said and beliefs. I went from reading garbage on 4chan and buying into their alt-right beliefs as a high schooler, to reading marx and fully committing to my new left-wing perspective in college. I don’t hate myself for these things, but I definitely hate the things that I did and am incredibly ashamed for buying into racist thinking.

The day i found out that he died before I was born, I literally cried.  That's how much of a fan of The King I am.  Why do we care about this in a liberal subreddit? You may be thinking...And I will tell you......

Because if Elvis Freaking Presley had showed up alive in 2015, and ran for president, and i voted for him bc like I said, love him (and yes i know someone will have something to say for that as well), were he the one who had marched off to Washington D.C. and promptly began to make an absolute jackass of himself while tearing families apart at the border all over some wall that's falling apart faster than they can get it put up, put more effort into wiping out the previous administrations agenda than any effort he put into an honest agenda of his own, almost started a war bc he just felt like taking out a high ranking general of a country we were not even at war with(sorry but that plane going down to me is on Trumps head and always will be.), and for brevity's sake I'm just going to cut to this week,  where they now have proof that he had his administration scrap a CDC warning about the coronavirus,  telling elderly people (as in grandpa and grandma, people)  not to fly to avoid contracting COVID-19, BC he didn't want it to affect the stock market if they stopped buying airplanes tickets... if it were Elvis who had done this, if it were Mother Freaking Theresa,  who had done this...if it were Puff the magic dragon with superman and Mr. Rogers who had done this, I would be raising holy hell about them instead of about Trump!! So many people have started picking at my posts as though I'm treating this man unfairly,  and the truth is,  he hasn't treated the USA fairly since the day he was inaugurated!  The first thing he said when he sat down at a table with his administration and the Congress, was to lie and say that he actually won the popular vote,  that they had proved voter frauds with over one million votes.  Nancy Pelosi immediately called him out on it. Started straight out the gate with a provable lie.  
I genuinely feel for Trump, bc he has been brought up by a family of grifters who believe if you're not rich and perfect, you're nothing.  They're these perfectly coiffed mannequins filled to the brim with shiny gold coins,  but what happens to them when gold loses its value, and the only thing you have at the end of the day is the love of your family and the spouse at your side? I do not care who you are, or how many buildings have your name on them.  When you traumatize children by separating them from their families indefinitely, locking them in places to be hurt, abused,  and yes, in one instance, die alone in his own vomit , to me you are the poorest of poor, and in no way in this life or the next a success.  When you value a digital sign with arrows and numbers over the 22 lives that have been lost(I'm quite sure that's more at this point), and the more that will surely come, you are less than a man. I don't care who you are,  or what you do.  If these are your actions, shame on you.  Shame on your family,  shame on your legacy,  shame on your heritage, and shame that you only have a black hole where you should have had a heart.",1583921285.0

Now I know my a lot of other progressives like Kyle Kulinsky and Jimmy Dore view this election as a lost cause since they view Biden as Hillary 2.0. heck even some of non-political friends think Biden is Hillary 2.0 and won't win election. 

They often state how Trump will destroy Biden in the debates and for whatever reason claim his mind is deteriorating pointing to his word fumbles. As far as Biden sounding strange [here is an LA times article about verbal audibles that stutters use](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-03-19/joe-biden-stutter-speech)

As far as the debates are concerned I feel like everyone forgot how Trump did in the presidential debates himself back in 2016. The guy was nuts. Even during debates where he sounded sane to start it only lasted like 5 minutes before he went completely off the rails. They also seen to forget how Joe Biden did against Paul Ryan back in 2012.  

So I don't think he'll perform as poorly as people think he will. 

Back in the 2016 primaries the states typically labelled as the Blue wall and I'm going to focus on Midwest states.

Wisconsin Bernie won 57% 

Michigan Bernie barely won with 49.68

Illinois Hillary won 50.56% it was close Bernie got 48.61%

I mention those states cause in general election.  Trump won Michigan and Wisconsin. 

In 2020 Democratic Primaries. 

In Michigan Biden won 50% to Bernie's 34%

In Illinois Biden crushed at 59% to Bernie's  36%

According to 538 based on polls in Wisconsin Biden is set to win big again. 

Plus President Trump has made several missteps during his presidency. 

Declaring he is a nationalist: [here](https://youtu.be/sazitj4x6YI) 

As relates to current events: [this was something Trump did literally when he first got into office ](https://youtu.be/8wTCknfXJGs)

President Obama installed a Pandemic team for this very situation. Could that have stopped or radically contained what's happening now. I can't really say cause College Frat crowd like those in Hawaii and Florida are gonna be dumb and reckless but it may have alerted them to get more tests. 

Trump's action during this pandemic has been slow and awful and very inefficient. And now we are facing a recession and a possible potential depression (I'm not really sure if we will fall that much) 

And as far as Allan Lichtmans 13 keys I have 5 keys flipped against Trump. And Lichtmans says if it is 6 keys then the challenger. Wins. Depending on how next few weeks goes I may get 6.

End Statement:

The states a lot of key states that Hillary to Bernie in primaries then in general to Trump Biden has won most of them with some very handily.

Those states just don't view Biden as Hillary 2.0.

As far as debates I think Biden will do well against Trump. 

Trump's ignorance towards science is hurting the economy and people's lives 

I do legit think Biden can win against Trump.

Update: one thing I do want to add is that since 2000 to 2016 republicans have gone after Hillary all the time putting smear campaigns on the regular. And it also didnt help being under investigation over email servers.

Joe doesn't have that either.",1584894967.0

578,Are state local Democratic official committed prosecuting crime ICE agent contractor ?,57,cw3v7t,Liberal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/cw3v7t/are_there_any_state_or_local_democratic_officials/,5,"This seems like a pretty straightforward case of law-and-order needing to be restored.  Under the Trump insurgency, ICE no longer operates as a law enforcement agency, but as a criminal conspiracy tied to hate groups.  

They openly break the law on a constant basis, engage in kidnapping and false imprisonment, hostage-taking, extortion rackets, ransom demands, child endangerment/abuse/neglect, and first degree murder by causing the deaths of their captives.

So regardless of whatever technicality or maneuver the regime might try to avoid justice, I'd like to know if any state or local Democratic officials are committed to pursuing it.  E.g., 

* Ordering CPS visits to children in detention.

* Seeking arrest warrants for ICE agents, officials, and contractors.

* Seeking restraining orders against same.

Etc.

The Token Opposition Media (TOM - perfect acronym) basically never reports on anything tangible being done to fight the insurgents, so for those of us not directly involved in a given issue, we're left thinking that nothing at all is happening outside of what we personally know.",1566938301.0

582,Shit Trump . An essay,55,fyhp9h,Liberal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/fyhp9h/shit_trump_did_an_essay/,46,"

I wanted Warren. I wanted Bernie over Biden. I wanted several candidates more than Biden. Nonetheless:

**2020 is SO much bigger than Biden**

A 2020 Trump Presidency would mean:

- A conservative judiciary the *rest of your life.* A likely 7-2 SCOTUS, and another of lifetime federal judge appointments.

This means unfavorable rulings for: climate change, abortion, gerrymandering, executive power, executive oversight, Congressional authority, civil rights, immigration issues (children in cages), and so, so much more. You can basically say goodbye to this for decades to come with a Trump Presidency. Everything Bernie, Warren, Democrats, and progressives ever stood for is going to take a sledgehammer with a Trump Presidency.

- It would mean the continuing takeover of an authoritarian rule. Trump has argued he is immune from indictments, from oversight, from the courts, and he has a DOJ and Republican Senate to help him solidify his role as America's King.

- It would mean further emboldening of a worrying white nationalist, conspiratorial presence in America. Racism, sexism, xenophobia, wild conspiracies, and more would be given a green light.

- The continued isolation of America on the world stage. Every country on the planet besides NK, Saudi Arabia, and Russia does. not. trust. us. anymore. We are a mockery on the world stage in everything we do.

- The most corrupt cabinet in history. William Barr, Betsy DeVos, Mnuchin, Wheeler, Pence. It's like a super team of unqualified, horrendous people with enormous conflicts of interest. Every position is basically hired to deconstruct the agency they work for. The intelligence community is being flat-out purged for loyalists.

- A continuing WAR against climate change efforts and science. Undoubtedly the biggest issue humanity, including our children, grandchildren, and beyond will face.

No matter what your criticisms of Biden are,  

Let's remember who Trump is:

-Trump defrauded the government of [$400 million dollars.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html?mtrref=undefined&gwh=4C8152465110DAFBB00CA5F605A32C11&gwt=pay&assetType=REGIWALL)  
-Trump ran a fraudulent [charity](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/07/777287610/judge-says-trump-must-pay-2-million-over-misuse-of-foundation-funds) (one that supported veterans and children with cancer) and [university](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/04/10/trump-university-settlement-judge-finalized/502387002/).  
-Trump cheated on his third wife with a porn star and illegally paid her to keep quiet before an election.  
-Trump committed at least [5 felony instances of Obstruction of Justice.](https://medium.com/@dojalumni/statement-by-former-federal-prosecutors-8ab7691c2aa1), including trying to get Mueller (the man investigating him) fired... twice.

-Trump has [over twenty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_sexual_misconduct_allegations) sexual misconduct/assault allegations.

At the end of the day, we have a choice to make in November as reasonable adults and Americans. 





President Trump is corrupt and has surrounded himself with corrupt criminals. Here is a growing list of criminal investigations and convictions into President Trump and his associates. This is America under his leadership;

- 1) **Trump Foundation was forced to dissolve and court ordered to pay $2 million for misusing charity funds for personal use:** The president's charity was investigated for misusing the charity for personal gain.^[[1]](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/14/new-york-ag-files-lawsuit-against-trump-foundation-for-alleged-illegal-conduct-trump-says-wont-settle.html) The Trump Foundation dissolved following an investigation led by the New York Attorney General.^[[2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/nyregion/ny-ag-underwood-trump-foundation.html) President Trump was ordered to pay $2 million for misusing funds.^[[3]](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/07/777287610/judge-says-trump-must-pay-2-million-over-misuse-of-foundation-funds)

>""The Trump Foundation has shut down, funds that were illegally misused are being restored, the president will be subject to ongoing supervision by my office, and the Trump children had to undergo compulsory training to ensure this type of illegal activity never takes place again,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office filed the case, said in a statement. ""The court's decision, together with the settlements we negotiated, are a major victory in our efforts to protect charitable assets and hold accountable those who would abuse charities for personal gain.""

- 2a) **President Trump's Personal Attorney Michael Cohen plead guilty to committing campaign finance violation at the direction of Trump:**^[[4]](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/21/michael-cohen-striking-deal-with-federal-prosecutors.html) Michael Cohen was sentenced to 3 years in prison.^[[5]](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/us-politics/article-former-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-sentenced-to-three-years-in-prison/)

>*Pg. 11*

>During the campaign, Cohen played a central role in two similar schemes to purchase the rights to stories - each from women who claimed to have had an affair with Individual-1 - so as to suppress the stories and thereby prevent them from influencing the election. With respect to both payments, Cohen acted with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election. Cohen coordinated his actions with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of payments. In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1.

- 3) **Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn:** originally pleaded guilty to 1 charge of lying to the FBI, he was given a deal as long as he cooperated with investigators.^[[7]](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/michael-flynn-to-plead-guilty-to-making-false-statements-to-fbi/) However, Flynn recently fired his lawyers, is refusing to cooperate with investigators, and may go to prison for charges that weren't originally laid.^[[8]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-10/flynn-s-no-prison-deal-in-doubt-as-u-s-reveals-second-thoughts) Due to Flynn suddenly refusing to cooperate U.S. Prosecutors have produced extensive evidence indicated that the Turkish government attempted to influence the Trump Campaign by bribing Flynn, including a plan to extradite a Turkish cleric living in exile in America.^[[9]](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/court-documents-flynn-turkey-1.5205387)

- 4) **Foreign Policy Advisor George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty:**^[[10]](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mueller-prison-papadopoulos-1.4790303) Papadopoulos was sentenced to two weeks in jail for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians.^[[11]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/us/politics/george-papadopoulos-sentencing-special-counsel-investigation.html)

- 5) **Deputy Campaign Chairman Richard Gates pleaded guilty:**^[[12]](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/rick-gates-pleads-guilty-will-cooperate-with-robert-mueller-probe) Rick Gates sentencing was delayed as he cooperated in several ongoing investigations.^[[13]](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/14/rick-gates-sentencing-mueller-probe-990758) He was recently sentenced to 45 days of jail and 3 years of probation.^[[14]](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-trump-campaign-official-richard-gates-sentenced-to-45-days-in-jail-3-years-probation-11576601543)

- 6) **Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort was convicted for committing several crimes:** Manafort was sentenced to 47 months for bank and tax fraud charges.^[[15]](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/paul-manafort-sentenced-on-bank-and-tax-fraud-charges) Moreover, Manafort was convicted on foreign lobbying and witness tampering charges and will be in prison for 7 years.^[[16]](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/paul-manafort-sentenced-on-foreign-lobbying-and-witness-tampering-charges)

- 7) **Trump Campaign Adviser and long time friend of President Trump - Roger Stone found guilty:** Trump Campaign Adviser Roger Stone was indicted by Special Counsel Mueller.^[[17]](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/roger-stone-indicted-on-several-charges-as-part-of-muellers-russia-collusion-probe) A jury found Stone guilty on all 7 counts including witness tampering, lying, and obstruction.^[[18]](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/roger-stone-found-guilty-in-trial-stemming-from-mueller-probe)

The Republicans *think* they want high level Democrats on the stand, but what they really want is what Trump was attempting to do in Ukraine: no feedback from Democrats, simply the appearance of guilt (e.g., *announcements* of an investigation, not a *real* investigation). Once they get Biden, Biden's son, or (I pray for this) Adam Schiff on the stand, they'll see that berating and attacking those people on the stand is actually detrimental to their true aim: to make it seem as though the Democrats are the actual villains here.

In addition to that, it would increase viewership a hundredfold if these people were on the stand.

The evidence already indicts Trump, what harm could having the democrats on the stand have? If you're not sure if the Dems would make good witnesses, consider the following:

* People think Joe Biden is inarticulate but in reality he has a folksy charm that is difficult to counter. Putting him on the stand will make him seem attacked: *definitely* not what the Republicans want.
* Don't even get me started on how hard it would be to trip up Adam Schiff, even with a ""when did you stop beating your wife"" type of gotcha question.
* Hunter Biden already gave a good-faith interview that went really well in my opinion.

In other words, having Republican witnesses would actually play into the Democrats' hands.

There’s been a lot of (justified) outrage towards his comment, but instead of being angry at him we should be angry at ourselves. Republicans don’t just win because it’s not easy to vote, but because we as liberals don’t put in the effort to vote anyway. We forget to register, don’t vote because we don’t like the nominee, or vote for a third party with no chance of winning. Perhaps the most common is that many of us act like our vote doesn’t matter so we stay home on Election Day. Trump himself just said that isn’t true, and by staying home we are helping Republicans win and stay in office. It’s still months away, but don’t forget that he just gave us the playbook to getting himself and the rest of the Republicans out of office. Vote!",1585717492.0

Anyway my parents are very pro-having kids go right back to school once summer is over no matter what. According to them kids have a very low risk of getting COVID. 

Now to me, I think we ought to be a little more careful when dealing with a global pandemic. Not only that but schools (especially elementary schools) are germ factories. We can help kids catch up if they fall behind in their education. We can’t bring people back from the dead. 

They also had a big rant about teacher’s unions and how they’re full of people who just don’t want to work. Which to me is laughable considering how much teacher’s do especially for the amount of pay they receive.",1595048301.0

Our current testing rate is no where near there.

The fact that insurance companies want to look like saints cause they waived off Coronavirus testing is still fucked up. 

According to this [article](https://www.kens5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-testing-could-cost-up-to-2400-in-bexar-county/273-95786299-688e-40f5-87e0-5f6e513605e8) in San Antonio without insurance it could cost you $2400 just for the test. Let alone if you end up having it and need to be quarantined or worse need extra hospital care. 

What's worse about private insurance only in the US is those who aren't insured and their reluctance to go to hospital due to how much it costs. [article ](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/10/coronavirus-texas-poses-challenges-people-without-insurance/)

The people who can't afford insurance likely can't afford to miss work. 

Universal Healthcare should be a key point that needs to be pushed in the presidential debates and the VP debates.

I’ve been trying to understand why so many people seem to hold views that are not only selfish but are actively horrible to certain sections of society. 

I mean, I get being rude in a supermarket queue or being an ass whilst driving - no single ideology has a monopoly on being a dick. 

I also sort of understand basic racists - they fear difference and manifest their fear as racism. 

I also get right wing politicians - mostly I feel that they act out of a desire to appeal to a certain type of voter or are acting out of self interest (ie money).

What I keep struggling with is why so many people perceive having liberal views as being bad. 

Since when has being concerned about fellow humans, the environment, animal welfare etc been seen as ‘being a snowflake/Marxist/soy boy’ etc? 

Even if I am a liberal cliché, why should that anger a conservative, since by definition I’m not a physical threat to them?

Brian Cox once said that the universe has a liberal bias - id like to believe that. I’d like to believe that being decent to each other is something we all want to aspire to. 
And yet when I dip into some of the conservative subs on reddit all I see is post after post of toxic masculinity, shrouded racism (with people arguing the ‘all lives matter’ position) and anti liberal rhetoric that manifests as name calling and homophobia.

I’m getting to my wits end.

Is there a country in the world that treats its citizens well?

I made a controversial comment which was understandably met with a negative response, but all the other downvoted comments I saw were reasonable thoughts. The only ""problem"" with them, was that they were liberal. It's not accepting and it's not congenial towards anyone with even a slightly dissenting opinion. 

The first post I saw, when I entered here a couple days ago, was a Conservative willing to have a discussion, and multiple people sharing their views in a peaceful and friendly manner.

The bill allows the government to **take away Section 230 protections** from certain companies that don't follow their requirements, and forces backdoors on encryption for law enforcement, which the government can access using **private courts** which will likely rubber stamp requests.

How do you deal with family that does not want/won't wear a mask? I have not hung out with mine in awhile, and they are taking it as if it were some personal slight against them. I feel like I am being rational as I have told them I am taking immunosupressive drugs, so I wear a mask. Since I know they don't take the same precautions, I said if you want to hang out, you need to wear one as well. 

This sends them off into a tizzy. Saying numbers are made up, it's not as bad as it seems, scientists are wrong...You know all the same psychobabble.

Democrat or Republican, no one listens to each other. It’s always “The Left is taking our rights” and “The Republicans are corrupt” I don’t f*cking care. Everyone is interrupting what the other person has to say and if they’re not, they’re thinking of what to say next! Maybe if we all came together and listened for once, we could get something done that we all agree with! What happened to “Divided we fall, United we stand!” For a while now, half of the country has hated the other, and vice versa! I’m sorry I’m ranting but seriously, we need to get our sh*t together. Maybe we recognize that extremists are extremists and should be treated as such and not the average joe on that political side. And don’t respond saying the other side won’t listen. There’s rational and irrational people on both side. For once, listen to each other. (Unless it’s something wrong like racism, sexism, and homophobia. Those guys are crazy) Anakin Skywalker has a line that represents today. “If you are not with me, then you are my enemy.”

EDIT 2: I don’t think that finding a middle ground with racists, fascists, homophobes, etc is a good thing, I said this in my paragraph. What I DO think is that there are some rational people that are conservative. Most people think the other side is best represented by the extremists of that group. Extremists from both sides are not the people I was referring to. I was talking about sitting down and having a civilized discussion with another rational human being that simply has a few key differences in political opinion. I am more left leaning and yet I get conservative ads. In these ads, there are far leftist people who are doing some sort of horrible thing and I realize that the news portrays the whole left side as the extremists and vice versa with the conservatives. Both sides do this. There are a lot of similarities between them. Their main news portrays the extremists while labeling them as average for that political party. Then the conservatives think the same thing we do about them. Those who support trump are idiots and extremists. There are a lot of conservatives realizing trump is a disgusting human being.

Anyway, so after this transition I've really taken note of how deluded Trump supporters have become as of June, 2020. I frequently attend protests happening atm and I can just tell it annoys the shit out of my dad. He's an almost alt-right, conspiracy theorist conservative who despises ""snowflake"" liberals. However I don't hate him by any means, but recently his politics have become volatile to the point where I'm the black sheep of the family for being liberal.

My dad has always been a conservative Republican, although he has softened his viewpoints around some certain social issues in the past couple of years, I like to think because of some of my convincing and also the fact that I’m gay and he’s had to deal with that if he wants me in his life. Anyways, we like to talk about politics a lot. He doesn’t like Donald Trump personally and thinks Trump is an idiot, but when I’m trying to convince him for the sake of the country and my future to vote Trump out, he always resorts to muddying the waters and what I view as a false equivalency argument of a general “Democrats are just as bad as Republicans”. It’s an argument that drives me nuts because no matter what I say, he’s always pointing out incidences of malfeasance by Democrats as a counterargument, true or not, potentially changing the subject, and not focusing on the issue we are discussing at hand. 

For example, when discussing Trump’s impeachment, he tries to turn the discussion to Biden or to Bill Clinton’s impeachment as a counterpoint, instead of focusing on Trump’s actions and whether they’re right or wrong. I know this is a pretty common tactic, but I’m wondering if any of you have had success convincing family members to change their mind/vote on Trump, and what tactics you used to do so. I feel like I’m making headway with my father and since I know he doesn’t like Trump, I’m trying to figure out ways I can push him over the edge to change his mind.

Thousands of people, children included, are injured or die as a result of poor firearm safety each year. We can debate the measures in which to take to curb these numbers but it all starts with education. Here are the 4 rules of gun safety and they should be followed at all times:

&#x200B;

1. **Treat all guns as if they are always loaded.**
2. **Never let the muzzle cover anything that you are not willing to destroy.**
3. **Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on target and you have made the decision to shoot.**
4. **Be sure of your target and what lies beyond it.**

**Bonus Rule: Always Secure Your Firearm from Unauthorized Persons.**

Let’s not be them. Let’s be better and hopefully someone like Mitt Romney or another younger generational Republican can come along and restore the Republican party to a reasonable side of the aisle.

As a young child,  I was homeschooled by a fanatically religious family  (yeah, check out my posts in nparents.) And so I knew a good deal about the Holocaust,  due to studying the book 'The Hiding Place 'by Corrie Ten Boom.  I also went to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC, which a a very sobering and shocking experience to say the least. I consider myself a seeker of odd facts and trivia,  so when i just now at age 35 learned of the Greenwood Massecre in Tulsa, Ok, i was nonplussed. Today,  I just finished the season finale of Penny Dreadful; City of Angels. Now I pick up on certain things in movies and series very early on, (my family used to call it my sixth sense)  and one thing I noticed very quickly was an emphasis on the clothes worn by a group of Latinos called the Pachucos. I asked my husband about this group,  and if it really existed.  He responded that for the people living in the city of Mexico, Pachucos were somewhat like rednecks.  Still, the clothes worn by the Pachucos were a tailored toe of suit, with an excess of fabric in the hips and thigh area for the purpose of easier dancing to swing and jazz music.  It wasn't until a scene where the antagonist basically starts a race riot (yes, if you watch this series, it's UNCANNY and somewhat disturbing how similar in tone to where we in the United States are at in this moment) and naval sailors come pouring out if abar and began to attack whatever Latino they managed to get their hands on,  that I made the connection;  the Zoot Suit Riots. So again, I asked my son if he had heard of any this, and he said no. I've asked several other younger people about these things,  the Holocaust, Greenwood,  the Zoot Suit Riots (the emphasis was placed on the name because,  go figure, the policemen mercilessly beat whatever Latinos they found, and tore off their clothes. See wikipedia for an actual, heartrending photo of this.)

So here is my question; if we're not teaching all of history,  are we not forcing future generations to relive the same errors?  As the saying goes ""Those who cannot not remember the past will be condemned to repeat it. "" And just as a little treat, because my ADHD took hold and so I looked up who said this, here's the entire quote in its context; 
""Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" 

Why is it, that the year 2020 is upon us,and yet my neighboring state is just now striking the Confederate flag off its own? Why do kids in publius schools now not learn of the Holocaust,  the Trail of Tears,  Greenwood Massecre, The Zoot suit Riots , and all those things that are testimonies of how our nation has forever struggled with tribalism and racism? Why are people so determined to pretend that our nation was formed by saints and not sinners who had a zeal and lust for life that would not be denied?  Were O to be discovered to be a serial killer after my death, should people not cease to writings and my life? It would be only right.  So what is happening, that they are ceasing to truly educate these generations about the truth of history and days past?  With whom does this fault lie,  and how can we repair these errors so that we are not indeed condemned to repeat the past?",1593499298.0

837,Alright got,8,hdh73d,Liberal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/hdh73d/alright_you_got_me/,17,"Hello all, at risk of being flamed I think I need to provide a bit of background before I get to the point. I have been a slightly conservative, mostly libertarian person for a long time. I am really pro 2nd amendment and until recently I have aligned much more with the free market approach to healthcare than anything else. Honestly, those have been my only sticking points with liberal ideology. Healthcare isn't one of them anymore.

My employer reopened a few weeks ago with a strict mask policy. I have followed it along with most of my coworkers. One guy refused to saying, ""I just don't like being told what to do."" Despite the strict policy, our bosses didn't do anything to make him wear a mask even though he was also going to parties and out to bars whenever he had the chance. I just have to say, I'm in the camp of, ""I carry a firearm to protect myself, I'll wear a mask to protect myself and others because it is the right thing to do"" and while I sometimes forget to wear it when I run into the grocery store or gas station, I'm generally pretty good about it and I have worn it at work since we went back.

Anyway, problem with authority guy tested positive for COVID yesterday after being sent home from work when he came in still not wearing a mask with a fever and complaining about being sick. I've spent most of the afternoon trying to figure out where I can get tested in my insurance network so I don't get a huge bill.

To get back to the point. I believe personal responsibility is really important and I have used this principal to justify my belief in free market healthcare for a long time. I was wrong. My other coworkers and I all followed the rules for the mask policy and now all of us are not able to go into work because one guy was irresponsible. We haven't been told if we will continue to be paid or not while quarantining, which is another level of stress we don't need. We were all responsible and we all got screwed because someone didn't want to cooperate. The closest testing location to me will include a copay of several hundred dollars and was unsure if my insurance would cover the test at all. I'm done with this stupid American health insurance system. I stayed home in the 2016 election because I hated both candidates. I'm not staying home this time.",1592812045.0
838,Conservatives telling `` half truth '' problem country .,9,hdah8p,Liberal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/hdah8p/conservatives_telling_half_truths_is_a_problem_in/,18,"I'm talking about conservatives who knows enough about a topic to make a point but doesn't say enough about it that would prove that they're wrong.

It's like someone saying: Water is poisonous. 
But the truth is, someone put toxic wastes in the water to make it poisonous.

The person makes a point but they don't tell the whole truth.

What does this have anything to do with conservatives? So conservatives are always making these kinds of points. They're mostly towards white privilege and systematic racism. When they don't tell the whole truth about those concepts that plague's our society they are getting other conservatives to believe what they are saying which causes them to not even want to look up the whole truth because they think they know it all at that point.

When we have conservatives talking about certain topics like they know it all, maybe even point out some stuff that is true, but doesn't tell the whole truth that disproves their point, it causes more people to intake this information and believe the lies these people are spreading. 

This is a problem that must be fixed.",1592788228.0

Hello everyone so today i wanted to rant about something and kind of get it of my chest because it has really been stressful for me. I really have been struggling with my xenophobic uncles, since they always been hateful towards minorities and different races/ ethnicities and my uncles in the past have been saying that they wanted to burn all Albanians but they also naivly use Hitler to call anybody who doesn't agree with them in other trivial issues like when someone is more opinionated than them etc, so i assume they kind of go with the flow of society not really having any groud or basis for their beliefs / academic education or knowledge on the topic of politics just overall hatred, even for the LGBT community they used to harass people that wouldn't fit to that narative of macho man and feminine girl that they would debate their intelligence compared to male, and i live in Greece so for Greeks population in general there is usually an antagonization towards Albanians Turkey and immigrants in general, so i've been trying to avoid them since it has been really annoying in the past talking with them and bullying me for not looking man enough, so anyway because i've been estranging them they do find a way to message me on social media and send me these videos of their dearest politicians that they are indoctrinated into from their religious culture etc. So i do understand them but my uncle this time posted a video of a politician talking about evidence they have that they're paying for immigrants.

So im going to denotation of the sittuation and what i see here happening.

Initially they did discover that ""we are paying for the immigrants"" and they are suddenly all traumatised by it , second they react like they did recently realize that we have immigrants and now they are terrorized or petrified that we are having immigrants. So therefore im assuming that this is the incentive they have to blame and going through their individual lifes and experiences they can associate this with every difficulty, complexity , labour , struggling etc. So these politicians do advocate and appeal to the commoner's nationalist sensitivity and fear of immigration since over the 50% of the country right now is right leaning and my uncles right now have been more and more drawn to populist conspiracy theorist social circle and friends so i think this is probably the right time to disassociate myself from them completely",1578955458.0

855,Malice normalizing : What phrase `` virtue signal '' tell u everyday evil right-wing .,10,djsv94,Liberal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/djsv94/malice_normalizing_what_the_phrase_virtue_signal/,10,"Communication is what defines human beings, both as individuals and societies.  What we share is what makes us capable of more than other animals, building a common memory and purpose among multitudes without sacrificing individual autonomy.  Therefore, what we choose to communicate is critically important to who and what people are.

Once we establish this, it comes as no surprise that the political right obsessively uses the phrase ""virtue signal"" - an otherwise legitimate criticism of *shallow* communication - to essentially mean all expression related to or *embodying*... **virtue**.  In other words, virtue itself is ""virtue signaling.""

The implication is as twisted as it is unsurprising from such people: They are saying virtue is not real, and any communication of morals that would wound their ego is some form of empty vanity on the part of *others*.  

It's part of a long, sad pattern of narcissism with them: Condemned for lying, they declare that truth is not real.  Condemned for malice from positions of power, they insist that compassion is for weaklings.  And condemned for the petty malice they practice in everyday life, they retreat to the rhetorical gambit of labeling it a fiction meant to capitalize on social approval.  

Got that?  

""Please"" and ""Thank you"" = virtue signaling.

""I love you"" = virtue signaling.  

""I do"" in a marriage ceremony = virtue signaling.

""Love thy neighbor"" = virtue signaling.

""We the people"" = virtue signaling.

""I have a dream"" = virtue signaling.

""...one giant leap for mankind"" = virtue signaling.

Using the words ""good,"" ""right"" (except for directional or political wing), ""justice,"" ""decency,"" ""honor,"" ""integrity,"" ""compassion,"" ""empathy,"" or any other term for a morally desirable quality = virtue signaling, as is using their antonyms for the opposite.

Have you ever done anything good?  Well then, you better hide the fact from right-wingers, because it will hurt their feelings by reminding them that they're bad people.  And, of course, because their ego is more important than the truth, it's incumbent on you to protect them from their own character flaws rather than on them to ever change.

If you run into them doing this, using the phrase ""virtue signaling"" to shout down morality, just remember this phrase and call it what it is: **Malice normalizing**.  They want to pretend their malignant hypocrisy is some sort of insightful commentary, when in fact they're just denying that virtue is real because they have none.

[Edit: Looks like this struck a nerve with Trumpsky brigaders.  Neutralizing their ""virtue signal"" Tourette's is clearly a threat to them.  Be sure to show appreciation for their encouragement the next time you see it, and dismiss their ""malice normalizing.""]",1571457229.0

He said ""Of course."" What I meant by this is that there is no functional or fundamental reason why any adult citizen should not participate in our government, yet we have a long history of allowing arbitrary distinctions of category to prevent some people from attaining positions of power. 

Because I think this is something people don't often think about, the symbolic meaning of things. Having a Black man in the highest office in the land, co-equal to Congress and the Supreme Court, is a tacet acknowledgement that Black folks have the right to hold a position of power. No one ever doubts the right of white men to hold power (no offense to white men, it's just a fact) because they have always held these positions in our nation and the world. So, symbolically, electing a Black President acknowledged not just him, but a whole segment of society as having a legitimate right to hold ultimate power.

The kind of people who can't stand that tend to be also the kind who have an ingrained adherence to a rigid heirarchical power structure and obedience to authority. So for eight long (to them) years, they felt they had to abide by their own rules of respect for power and hold in their natural resistance to and abhorrence of Black people because of what a Black President respected symbolically.

Then when ""birtherism"" arose, they were overjoyed, because it gave them an ""out"" to their existential torment. Obama's election was illegitimate because he was not elgible to run for the presidency at all! It was all a big mistake, Black folks were not their equals, and everything could go back to how it was before. Trump was an early and conspicuous proponent of birtherism, and he represented their only hope of making this painful change go away psychologically. When Trump was elected, his opinions and policies were elected along with him, and made it all ""true"" for them. Because he is uniquely associated with birtherism, he is seen as the only one to cancel out what Obama's election represents.

This is why we now see these people crawling out of the woodwork, going around trying to put Black folks back in their ""place"" by saying ugly shit to them and calling the cops on them for nothing at all. In their minds, nothing had been ""great"" since Obama's election symbolized Black folks being equal participants in society, and that's what they really mean by ""make America great again.""

Meanwhile, in their minds, the co-equal branches of government have been ""tainted"" by association with the Black President, and this is why they want to tear it all down and make sure there are only like-minded people in any position of power whatsoever -- they want to make certain such a thing will never happen again, so they can collectively negate the symbolic change that made them so miserable.

913,Why conservative like union ?,7,e6jege,Liberal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/e6jege/why_dont_conservatives_like_unions/,25,"so I am pretty much in the middle politically, but have a few right leaning beliefs. But one thing I never understood is why more conservative people don't like unions?

I vaguely know that there's something about paying union dues, but are they that much? workplace etc...) to change, right? So wouldn't a union of workers all coming together and saying to their boss(es) ""hey! We want more money, better treatment etc... and won't make you any more money till we do so!"" be a reflection of that?

I vaguely know that theres something about paying union dues, but are they that much?

Just looking for some clarification. Thanks!

EDIT: I appreciate the feedback, but I still am lost on what exactly they say to workers that makes them hate unions? I am talking about the people that would actually use a union.

Edit #2: ok no one has actually explained shit. All you've done is say ""hurr durr Republicans bad."" I had a lot more hope for this sub. But you really are two sides of the same coin. Ugh.",1575591448.0

► Trump was first compromised by the Russians in the 80s. In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use[ Trump real estate to launder money.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/is-there-a-case-for-trump-putin-collaboration-years-before-the-campaign/2018/08/16/00578f1e-9440-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html) In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.

► In 1984, David Bogatin — a convicted Russian mobster and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss — met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/nyregion/entrepreneur-who-left-us-is-back-awaiting-sentence.html), Apr 30, 1992)

► [Felix Sater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater } is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. [He is a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. ](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-felix-sater-trump-associate-at-center-of-the-mueller-russia-probe-2018-11 ) He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former ""fixer"" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.

► Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and [Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardbehar/2016/10/03/donald-trump-and-the-felon-inside-his-business-dealings-with-a-mob-connected-hustler/#873b09222824 ) Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.

► In July 2008, the height of the housing bust, [Trump sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev,](https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/20190217/trump-in-palm-beach-did-russian-mansion-buyer-make-money ) a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value.

► Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. [Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/trumps-top-targets-in-the-russia-probe-are-experts-in-organized-crime/569056/) That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years. Many of them owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties. They were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel.

► From Craig Unger's AMA: ""Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Every time I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich. When you do investigative reporting, you anticipate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you know New York you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence.""

►  So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was [living at Trump Tower](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate)

► According to a [Bloomberg investigation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-16/behind-trump-s-russia-romance-there-s-a-tower-full-of-oligarchs ) (3/16/2017) into Trump World Tower,  “a third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states.”

► In 2013, Federal agents busted an “ultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring” run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. They operated card games, illegal gambling websites, and a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. [A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a “sophisticated money-laundering scheme” connected to Semion Mogilevich.](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate)

► The Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. [Russia is a mafia state.](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/05/19/inside-vladimir-putins-mafia-state ) That is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.

►  Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive. Now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the [FBI described Kislin as having ties to the Russian mob.](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/fbi-tracked-alleged-russian-mob-ties-of-giuliani-campaign-supporter/ ) Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.

► A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. [The NRA](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/27/764879242/nra-was-foreign-asset-to-russia-ahead-of-2016-new-senate-report-reveals ) got as much as $70M from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnell [got millions from Leonard Blavatnik.](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/mcconnells-biggest-donor-isnt-russian/ ) In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. Craig Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money.

► At the Cityscape USA’s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Donald Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, [saying ""...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.""](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jr-said-money-pouring-in-from-russia-2018-2)

► Eric Trump told golf reporter James Dodson in 2014 that the Trump Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because “We don’t rely on American banks. [We have all the funding we need out of Russia.”](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/eric-trump-donald-golf-courses-russia-funding-golf-writer-interview-2014-james-dodson-a7722806.html)

► Russian oligarchs [co-signed Trump’s Deutsche bank loans.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lawrence-odonnell-source-says-russian-oligarchs-co-signed-trumps-deutsche-bank-loans)

Trump now gleefully takes cues from Putin:

► At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies started making a strong push for a resolution that would justify their country’s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that condemned it. The Putinists’ goal was to pass the resolution by Feb. There is no one on this side of the Atlantic who thinks the USSR was justified in invading Afghanistan. And out of nowhere, on January 2nd, [Trump came out strongly supporting Russia's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/03/politics/trump-cabinet-meeting-afghanistan-soviet-union/index.html)

► Trump went against American intelligence on North Korean missiles. He told the FBI he [didn't believe their intelligence because Putin told him otherwise.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-north-korea-missiles-putin-russia-nuclear-andrew-mccabe-book-fbi-a8780786.html ) “I don't care, I believe Putin""

► [Trump refused to enforce sanctions](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-russia-sanctions-trump-no-new-congress-law-election-hacking-intervention-putin-kremlin-a8184866.html) legally codified into law - and in some cases reversed standing sanctions on Russian companies.

► He has denounced his own intelligence agencies in a press conference with Putin on election meddling - [and publicly endorsed Putin's version of events.](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-putin-press-conference-election-meddling-2018-7)

► Trump [pulled out of the INF treaty](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/02/politics/nuclear-treaty-inf-us-withdraws-russia/index.html) with no explanation, which allows Putin to create long-range hypersonic missiles that threaten Europe with impunity. The US already has all the weaponry that the INF would ban the development of, so this offers us literally nothing, while allowing Russia to develop powerful new weapons to challenge our allies.

► [Demanded Russia get invited back into G7](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/politics/trump-russia-g7.html)

► Withdrew from the [Open Skies treaty](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2020/05/21/trump-admin-to-withdraw-from-open-skies-treaty/)

► [Received intelligence in 2019 that Russia was paying bounties for dead American soldiers,](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53231840 ) and hasn't done anything about it by the time of this writing.

► And of course, [Trump continues to threaten to pull out of NATO,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html ) a move so catastrophically stupid, so inconceivably cosmically myopic, I truly can't express the profundity of the idiocy.

955,How avoid pushed Right,5,eom51z,Liberal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/eom51z/how_to_avoid_being_pushed_to_the_right/,38,"Hello, everyone! I'm looking for some constructive feedback on an issue I'm having as a liberal.

I've always been pretty firmly on the left on almost every issue, though I am able to effectively empathize with those on the right. The problem is that, lately, a lot of very vocal social media personalities and journalists have been souring my stance on race and gender issues.

Currently, the best examples I can give is in regards to the entertainment industry. Here are some posts on Twitter I've seen from rather loud voices give me a great deal of pause:

1. If your Spotify playlist, as far as artists go, lack women of color, you have a race problem.
2. The new star wars movie is terrible because it sidelined Kelly Marie Tran, a woman of color. These arguments usually go on about how the director is white, there should be more diversity, etc.
3. Awards shows (Golden Globes, Oscars, etc) are too white. Movies that highlight diversity in the industry are sidelined by moves starring and/or directed by white men.

These three examples bother me for the following reasons:

1. Why does my playlist have to feature a woman of color? Mine happens to do so (Santigold, for instance), but what if it didn't? I like the music I like. I happen to be really into renaissance era music, for instance. Not a lot of options there. Or, what if I like classic rock?
2. I understand the disappointment here for people who liked her character, or for those who view The Last Jedi as a step towards more diversity and the next movie as being a step back from that. Also, I understand she got a lot of racist backlash in the last movie, and they view this as those racists winning by her exclusion. However, the fact that the lead of the new trilogy was a woman seems to be old news and no longer enough. What is enough? When one of every race and gender is represented somehow on equal footing in every movie, even when that makes little sense from a story perspective?
3. I agree that the awards shows are skewed on the white male side, and I think this speaks towards a problem with representation and other issues in the industry, of course. But, if the majority of people in these roles are white and/or men, then should we ignore the good performances by them in favor of representing people of color? 

There's a lot more to all of this that I could surely drone on and on about, but I don't want this to be too overly long. If I'm confusing on a certain point or something, please feel free to ask before just lambasting me for how I feel about something. I'd love to discuss these things.

Finally, a message to the social media personalities I'm having an issue with: Your stances are actually serving to nudge me away from my lifelong support of racial and gender issues and pushing me into the arms of the more conservative white men you're fighting against. I don't know if you realize you're doing this or if this is your intention, but I feel there has to be a better way. Maybe I'm just misunderstanding your message.

Anyways, I'm very confused and at a crossroads for all of this, and any and all input is welcome!

I should note that the article ""What Were The Makers Of ""Joker"" Even Upset About?"" by Scaachi Koul as well as her responses to comments on Twitter regarding it is the most recent thing that has sparked my confusion on this matter, so feel free to take a glance if you're curious about my motivation on this.

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read and respond!",1579041782.0

I’ll start. How about small inner city agencies that set up internships, but you have to have at least decent grades to get in. Just an off-the-cuff idea. Or maybe this isn’t solving the root problem?",1594524979.0
