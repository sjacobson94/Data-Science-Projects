# Data-Science-Projects

This repository is comprised of many of the data science projects I have worked on throughout my masters program at the University of Denver. 
Each was the final project of a class.

## HR Analytics (Python)

Final project for Data Science Tools 2 class. The goal was to predict whether or not a candidate who had taken data science courses through a company would be seeking new employment at that company after successful completion of the course.

## COVID-19 LDA (R)

Final project for Advanced Probability and Statistics class. Using COVID-19 papers obtained from [semanticscholar.org/Cord19](www.semanticscholar.org/Cord19), topic modeling was performed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to determine underlying topics based on the content of the abstracts.

## Political Sentiment Analysis (Python)

Final project for Data Science Tools 1 class. Twitter tweets and Reddit posts were scraped using certain political buzzwords that were either present either in the tweet or present in a predetermined subreddit. Sentiment analysis was performed on the cleaned posts based on the presence of the buzzword.

## NHL Player Analytics

Final project for Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Data Science. Using NHL player data from the 2018-2019 season, difference in cap hit between forwards and defensemen was analyzed as well as predicting player position based on player characteristics and statistics using Random Forest.
